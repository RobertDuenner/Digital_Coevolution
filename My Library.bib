  abstract = {In several reciprocal cross-infection experiments parasites were found to be significantly more adapted to their local host populations than to hosts from distant populations. We developed a metapopulation model, taking explicit account of both population densities and gene frequencies, to determine the influence of ecological and genetical parameters on the local adaptation of the parasites and on the spatial distribution of resistance and virulence genes. Our results point to the predominant effect of ecological parameters such as parasite growth rate and host and parasite migration rates on coevolutionary outcomes. In particular, the parasites are more likely to be adapted to their local host population than to allopatric hosts when the parasite migration rate is larger than the host migration rate. The opposite should be observed whenever hosts migrate more than parasites.},

  abstract = {Here we address the controversy between plant pathologists and invertebrate zoologists as to the genetic basis of infection. We show that the alternative models proposed by these groups represent two ends of a continuum. Specifically, the gene-for-gene (GFG) model of plant pathologists represents one end of a continuum, where a very broad host range is expected to occur in one pathogen genotype. The matching alleles (MA) model, favoured by invertebrate zoologists, represents the opposite end of the same continuum, where an exact genetic match is required for infection. Since it is known that matching-alleles models give highly dynamical behaviour and selection for recombination if parasites exert strongly negative effects on host fitness, we were especially interested in determining the nature of any such behaviour in the interior regions of the MA\textendash{}GFG continuum. We found that the highly dynamical aspects of matching-alleles models were observed across most of the continuum, and that recombination would increase geometric mean fitness over about half of the continuum.},

The fatty acid composition for the cryptomonads were different from the other algae. They contained high percentages of the polyunsaturated fatty acids 20:5u)3 (EPA) and 22:6w3 (DHA), which also are common in fish.

Recently, however, several people have explored theoretical aspects of the population genetics of host-parasite associations; these authors conclude that such associations may be responsible for much of the genetic diversity found within natural populations, from blood group polymorphisms (Haldane, 1949) to protein polymorphisms in general (Clarke, 1975, 1976) and to histocompatibility systems (Duncan, Wakeland \& Klein, 1980). It has also been argued that pathogens may constitute the selective force responsible for the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction in animal and plant species (Jaenike, 1978; Hamilton, 1980, 1981, 1982; Bremermann, 1980).},

The parasite has a well-defined seasonal transmission cycle that occurs regularly each year and intimately involves the primary mosquito host, Aedes cantator, and the intermediate copepod host, Acanthocyclops vernalis. In the spring, the microsporidium is horizontally transmitted from the copepod, where it appears to overwinter, to the mosquito via the ingestion of haploid spores produced in the copepod. Mosquitoes develop a benign infection,and females transmit the microsporidium transovarially to their progeny via infected eggs. Oviposition occurs during the summer and infected eggs hatch synchronously in the fall causing widespread epizootics. Infected larvae die, and the cycle is completed when meiospores are released into the pool and subsequently are eaten by A. vernalis,which reappears in the fall and early winter.Amblyospora connecticusthereby persists by surviving in one of two living hosts throughout most of its life cycle rather than in the extra-corporealenvironment.This represents an important survival strategy for A. connecticus as results show the salt marsh habitat to be a relatively unstable environment that is subject to periodic flooding and drying. The adaptive significance of utilizing an intermediate host in the life cycle is discussed as it directly facilitates transmission and enhances survival of the microsporidium.},

H. chapmani was enzootic and was maintained in a continuous cycle of horizontal transmission between each host. There were three distinct periods during the summer and fall when developing mosquito larvae acquired infections; each was preceded by or coincident with the detection of infected copepods. Results were corroborated in laboratory bioassays, wherein transmission was achieved in mosquito larvae that were reared in water and sediment samples taken from the site during the same time periods. The highest infection rates, ranging from 60\% to 48\%, were repeatedly observed during the first six weeks of larval development. These were coincident with the most sustained collections of infected copepods obtained during the year and highest levels of infection achieved in the laboratory transmission studies. The high prevalence rates of lethal infection observed in larval populations of C. melanura at this site are among the highest recorded for any mosquito-parasitic microsporidium and clearly suggest that H. chapmani is an important natural enemy of C. melanura. H. chapmani appears to overwinter in diapausing mosquito larvae but may also persist in copepods. The absence of vertical transmission in the life cycle of H. chapmani and the sole reliance on horizontal transmission via an intermediate host are unique survival strategies not seen among other mosquito-parasitic microsporidia. The epizootiological data suggest that this transmission strategy is a function of the biological attributes of the hosts and the comparatively stable environment in which they inhabit. The subterranean habitat is inundated with water throughout the year; copepods are omnipresent and C. melanura has overlapping broods. The spatial and temporal overlap of both hosts affords abundant opportunity for continuous horizontal transmission and increases the likelihood that H. chapmani will find a target host. It is hypothesized that natural selection has favored the production of meiospores in female host mosquitoes rather than congenital transfer of infection to progeny via ovarian infection as a strategy for achieving greater transmission success.},

  abstract = {The complete life cycle of the microsporidium Hyalinocysta chapmani is described from the primary mosquito host Culiseta melancira and the intermediate copepod host Orthocyclops modestus. Infections are initiated in larval C.melanura following the oral ingestion of uninucleate spores from infected copepods. Spores germinate within the lumen of the midgut and directly invade fat body tissue where all development occurs. Uninucleated schizonts undergo binary division (schizogony) followed by karyokinesis (nuclear division) to form diplokaryotic meronts. Merogony is by synchronous binary division. The onset of sporogony is characterized by the simultaneous secretion of a sporophorous vesicle and meiotic division of the diplokaryon resulting in the formation of eight ovoid meiospores enclosed within a sporophorous vesicle. Most infected larvae die during the fourth stadium and there is no evidence of a developmental sequence leading to vertical transmission. Hyalinocysra chapmapli is horizontally transmitted to 0. modestus via oral ingestion of meiospores. Infections become established within ovarian tissue of females and all parasite development is haplophasic. Uninucleate schizonts divide by binary division during an initial schizogonic cycle. Newly formed uninucleate cells produce a thin sporophorous vesicle and undergo repeated nuclear division during sporogony to produce a rosette-shaped, multinucleated sporogonial plasmodium with up to 18 nuclei. This is followed by cytoplasmic cleavage, sporogenesis, and disintegration of the sporophorous vesicle to form membrane-free uninucleate spores. Infected females eventually die and there is no egg development. The small subunit rDNA sequence of H. chapmani isolated from meiospores from C. rnelrrnura was identical to the small subunit rDNA sequence obtained from spores from 0. modestus, corroborating the laboratory transmission studies and confirming the intermediaxy role of 0 ntodesrus in the life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with closely related microsporidia from mosquitoes. Hyalinocysta chapniani did not cluster within described Antblyospor-n species and can be considered a sister group, warranting separate genus status.},

  abstract = {The epizootiology, transmission dynamics, and survival strategies employed by two mosquito-parasitic microsporidia that utilize copepods as intermediate hosts are examined in relation to the biological attributes of their hosts and the environments in which they inhabit. Amblyospora connecticus Andreadis, 1988, a parasite of Ochlerotatus cantator (Coquillett) and Acanthocyclops vernalis (Fischer) is found in an unstable salt marsh environment that is subject to periodic flooding and drying. Both hosts have distinct non-overlapping generations. A. connecticus exhibits a well-defined seasonal transmission cycle that relies heavily on maternal-mediated transovarial transmission by female O. cantator during the summer, and horizontal transmission via the copepod host during the spring (copepod to mosquito) and fall (mosquito to copepod). Its survival strategies include: delayed virulence, low pathogenicity and high tissue specificity that allow for transstadial transmission of horizontally acquired infections and maximum spore production, reliance on living hosts throughout most of its life cycle with overwintering in the copepod, polymorphic development that is well synchronized with host physiology, and production and dissemination of infectious spores that are coincident with the seasonal occurrence of susceptible stages in each host. Hyalinocysta chapmani Hazard et Oldacre, 1975, a parasite of Culiseta melanura (Coquillett) and Orthocyclops modestus (Herrick) is found in a comparatively stable, subterranean habitat that is inundated with water throughout the year. Copepods are omnipresent and C. melanura has overlapping broods. H. chapmani is maintained in a continuous cycle of horizontal transmission between each host throughout the summer and fall but lacks a developmental sequence leading to transovarial transmission in the mosquito host. It relies on living hosts for most of its life cycle and overwinters in diapausing mosquito larvae. Transstadial transmission does not occur and there is no dimorphic development in the mosquito host. The spatial and temporal overlap of both mosquito and copepod hosts during the summer and fall affords abundant opportunity for continuous horizontal transmission and increases the likelihood that H. chapmani will find a target host, thus negating the need for a transovarial route. It is hypothesized that natural selection has favoured the production of meiospores in larval female mosquitoes rather than congenital transfer of infection to progeny via ovarian infection as a strategy for achieving greater transmission success. Analysis of the molecular phylogeny data suggest that (1) transovarial transmission and the developmental sequence leading to ovarian infection have been secondarily lost in H. chapmani, as they occur in all other closely related genera, (2) the ancestral state included complex life cycles involving transovarial transmission and an intermediate host, and (3) mosquito-parasitic microsporidia are adjusting their life cycles to accommodate host ecological conditions.},

  abstract = {The Red Queen hypothesis (RQH) predicts that parasite-mediated selection will maintain sexual individuals in the face of competition from asexual lineages. The prediction is that sexual individuals will be difficult targets for coevolving parasites if they give rise to more genetically diverse offspring than asexual lineages. However, increasing host genetic diversity is known to suppress parasite spread, which could provide a short-term advantage to clonal lineages and lead to the extinction of sex. We test these ideas using a stochastic individual-based model. We find that if parasites are readily transmissible, then sex is most likely to be maintained when host diversity is high, in agreement with the RQH. If transmission rates are lower, however, we find that sexual populations are most likely to persist for intermediate levels of diversity. Our findings thus highlight the importance of genetic diversity and its impact on epidemiological dynamics for the maintenance of sex by parasites.},

Host\textendash{}parasite theory has classically assumed fluctuations either occur between highly specific genotypes (matching allele: MA) or from specialism to generalism (genefor-gene: GFG). However, while MA can only generate one mode of fluctuating selection, we show that GFG can in fact produce both rapid `within-range' fluctuations (among genotypes with identical levels of investment but which specialise on different subsets of the population) and slower cycling `between ranges' (different levels of investment), emphasising that MA is a subset of GFG. Our findings closely match empirical observations, although sampling rates need to be high to detect these novel dynamics empirically. Within-range cycling is an overlooked process by which fluctuating selection can occur in nature, suggesting that fluctuating selection may be a more common and important process than previously thought in generating and maintaining diversity.},

While agespecific mortality is considered to be the main determinant of the optimal allocation, some life-history strategies, such as delayed or skipped reproduction, may be better understood when also accounting for reproduction costs. Here, we present a two-pool indeterminate grower model that includes survival and energetic costs of reproduction. The energetic cost sets a minimum reserve required for reproduction, while the survival cost reflects increased mortality from low postreproductive body condition. Three life-history parameters determining agedependent energy allocation to soma, reserve, and reproduction are optimized, and we show that the optimal strategies can reproduce realistic emergent growth trajectories, maturation ages, and reproductive outputs for fish. The model predicts maturation phase shifts along the gradient of condition-related mortality and shows that increased harvesting will select for earlier maturation and higher energy allocation to reproduction. However, since the energetic reproduction cost sets limits on how early an individual can mature, an increase in fitness at high harvesting can only be achieved by diverting most reserves into reproduction. The model presented here can improve predictions of life-history responses to environmental change and human impacts because key life-history traits such as maturation age and size, maximum body size, and size-specific fecundity emerge dynamically.},

Using replicate seminatural populations of a coevolving freshwater invertebrate-parasite system (host: Daphnia magna, parasite: Pasteuria ramosa), we quantified the effects of ambient temperature and population mixing (physical flux within populations) on epidemic size and population health. Each population was seeded with an identical suite of host genotypes and dose of parasite transmission spores. Biologically reasonable increases in environmental temperature caused larger epidemics, and population mixing reduced overall epidemic size. Mixing also had a detrimental effect on host populations independent of disease. Epidemics drove parasite-mediated selection, leading to a loss of host genetic diversity, and mixed populations experienced greater evolution due to genetic drift over the season. These findings further our understanding of how diversity loss will reduce the host populations' capacity to respond to changes in selection, therefore stymying adaptation to further environmental change.},

Recent results from Hungary proved that a remarkably high parasitism rate (50\textendash{}66\%) can also be maintained constantly for several decades. In this paradoxical situation the reproductive success of the strongly exploited host population is lower than would be necessary for self-reproduction. We developed a model for a hypothetical host\textendash{}brood parasite system that demonstrated that immigration of naive individuals from a highly reproductive (``source'') host population might explain the survival of the highly parasitized (``sink'') population. Our results also showed the possibility of maintaining the high parasitism rate and the imperfection of the host's counter-adaptation against the brood parasite over a longer period. Gene flow was necessary to maintain both the acceptor genes and the non-mimetic cuckoo eggs in heavy parasitism. When the immigration rate was low (1\textendash{}2\%), an early expansion of the mimetic cuckoos was followed by a spread of anti-parasite defense, and consequently, the parasitism rate stabilized at a lower, but still relatively high level of about 45\textendash{}60\%.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Microsporidia in mosquitoes can be divided into two categories based on their life cycles and host-parasite relationships. Some species of microsporidia exhibit simple life cycles with one spore type responsible for oral (horizontal) transmission. They affect only one generation of the mosquito and are not usually host or tissue specific. Brachiola algerae (Vavra et Undeen, 1970) and Vavraia culicis (Weiser, 1947) are examples of species isolated from mosquitoes with relatively straightforward life cycles (one spore type) and simple host-parasite relationships. B. algerae and a close relative of V. culicis have also been isolated from a vertebrate (human) host but sources for these infections are unknown. In contrast to B. algerae and V. culicis, polymorphic (heterosporous) microsporidia in mosquitoes are characterized by complex life cycles involving multiple spore types responsible for horizontal and vertical transmission. They affect two generations of the mosquito and some involve an obligate intermediate host. These microsporidia are generally very host and tissue specific with complex develop-mental sequences comprised of unique stages and events. The microsporidium Edhazardia aedis (Kudo, 1930) is a pathogen of Aedes aegypti and does not require an intermediate host. The developmental cycle of E. aedis is characterized by four sporulation sequences, two in the parental host and two in the filial generation. Recent speculation relative to the source of B. algerae human infection have implicated infected mosquitoes and raised concerns about the safety of mosquito microsporidia in general. The subject of this review is to compare and contrast three species of microsporidia from mosquitoes, two with broad host ranges (B. algerae and V. culicis) and one specific to mosquitoes (E. aedis). This review describes features that distinguish mosquito-parasitic microsporidia with simple life cycles and broad host ranges from truly mosquito-specific microsporidian parasites with complex life cycles.},

The mechanisms underlying either coexistence or fixation of several competing strains have rarely been studied altogether. Conditions for coexistence have mostly been studied by population and community ecology, while rates of invasion and fixation have mostly been studied by population genetics. To provide a global understanding of the complexity of the dynamics observed in large clonal populations, we develop a stochastic model where three clones compete. Competitive interactions can be intransitive, and we suppose that strains enter the population via mutations or rare immigrations. We first describe all possible final states of the population, including stable coexistence of two or three strains or the fixation of a single strain. Second, we estimate the invasion and fixation times of a favorable mutant (or immigrant) entering the population in a single copy. We show that invasion and fixation can be slower or faster when considering complex competitive interactions. Third, we explore the parameter space assuming prior distributions of reproduction, death, and competition rates, and we estimate the likelihood of the possible dynamics. We show that when mutations can affect competitive interactions even slightly, stable coexistence is likely. We discuss our results in the context of the evolutionary dynamics of large clonal populations.},

Locally restricted interactions have been shown in particular to affect host resistance and tolerance. In this study we investigate the evolution of several types of host disease resistance strategies, alone or in combination, in spatially structured populations. We construct a spatially explicit, individual-based stochastic model where hosts and parasites interact with each other in a spatial lattice, and interactions are restricted to a given neighbourhood of varying size. We investigate several host resistance strategies, including constitutive (expressed in all resistant hosts), induced (expressed only upon infection), and combinations thereof. We show that a costly constitutive resistance cannot reach fixation, whereas an inducible resistance strategy may become fixed in the population if the cost remains low, particularly if it impacts host recovery. We also demonstrate that mixed strategies can be maintained in the host population, and that a higher investment in a recovery-boosting inducible resistance allows for a higher investment in a constitutive response. Our simulations reveal that the spatial structure of the population impacts the selection for resistance in a complex fashion. While single strategies of resistance are generally favoured in less structured populations, mixed strategies can sometimes prevail only in highly structured environments, e.g. when combining constitutive and transmission-blocking induced responses Overall these results shed new light on the dynamics of disease resistance in a spatially-structured host-pathogen system, and advance our theoretical understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of disease resistance, a necessary step to elaborate more efficient and sustainable strategies for disease management.},

Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the maintenance of genetic variation observed in natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection is a powerful type of balancing selection that maintains many natural polymorphisms, but it is also commonly misinterpreted. This review aims to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss the empirical data needed to accurately identify processes that generate or maintain diversity in nature. Finally, the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress is considered.},

A range of ecological factors, from differences in resource availability to differences in community composition, can generate such a mosaic of selection among populations, and thereby differences in the strength of coevolution. The result is a mixture of hotspots, where reciprocal selection is strong, and coldspots, where reciprocal selection is weak or absent, throughout the ranges of species. Population subdivision further provides the opportunity for nonadaptive forces, including gene flow, drift, and metapopulation dynamics, to influence the coevolutionary interaction between species.

While we still need to better understand how parasite-mediated speciation functions, it is even less clear how this process is affected by environmental change. Both rapid and gradual changes of the environment can modify host immune responses, parasite virulence and the specificity of their interactions. They will thereby change host\textendash{}parasite evolutionary trajectories and the potential for speciation in both hosts and parasites. Here, we summarise mechanisms of host\textendash{}parasite interactions affecting speciation and subsequently consider their susceptibility to environmental changes. We mainly focus on the effects of temperature change and nutrient input to ecosystems as they are major environmental stressors. There is evidence for both disruptive and accelerating effects of those pressures on speciation that seem to be context-dependent. A prerequisite for parasite-driven host speciation is that parasites significantly alter the host's Darwinian fitness. This can rapidly lead to divergent selection and genetic adaptation; however, it is likely preceded by more short-term plastic and transgenerational effects. Here, we also consider how these first responses and their susceptibility to environmental changes could lead to alterations of the species formation process and may provide alternative pathways to speciation.},

In C. parasitica, infection with CHV1 induces a hypovirulent phenotype with reduced virulence toward the chestnut tree (Castanea spp.) and thus controls chestnut blight in many European regions. In contrast, uninfected virulent C. parasitica have nearly eradicated the American chestnut in North America. We applied a full factorial design and assessed the fungal growth and sporulation of four C. parasitica strains, uninfected and infected with each of the four known CHV1 subtypes, at 12\cyrchar\CYRNJE, 18\cyrchar\CYRNJE, 24\cyrchar\CYRNJE, and 30\cyrchar\CYRNJE{}C. We found a significant (P {$\leq$} .0001) genotype-by-genotype-by-environment interaction, demonstrating the potential for a selection mosaic. As a consequence, different host and parasite genotypes would be selected under different climatic conditions, affecting the coevolutionary dynamics of the host-parasite interaction and the course of chestnut blight epidemics.

Such hosts offer other significant inclusive fitness benefits to parasites, however, such as increased mobility and migration potential. The parasite fauna of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is dominated by the directly transmitted ectoparasites Gyrodactylus bullatarudis and Gyrodactylus turnbulli. In the wild, close predatory and competitive interactions occur between the guppy and the killifish Rivulus hartii. Previous observations suggest that these fish can share gyrodactylids, so we tested experimentally whether these parasites can use R. hartii as an alternative host. In aquaria, G. bullatarudis was the only species able to transmit from prey to predator. Both parasite species transferred equally well to prey when the predator was experimentally infected. However, in semi-natural conditions, G. bullatarudis transmitted more successfully to the prey fish. Importantly, G. bullatarudis also survived significantly longer on R. hartii out of water. As R. hartii can migrate overland between isolated guppy populations, G. bullatarudis may have an enhanced ability to disperse and colonize new host populations, consistent with its wider distribution in the wild. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study demonstrating a predator acting as a paratenic host for the parasites of its prey.},

We tested the extent to which parasite-mediated selection by different parasite species influenced competition among clones of the cyclic parthenogen Daphnia magna. We monitored clone frequency changes in laboratory microcosm populations consisting of 21 D. magna clones. Parasite treatments (two microsporidians, Glugoides intestinalis and Ordospora colligata) and a parasite-free control treatment were followed over a nine-month period. A further treatment with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa failed. We found significant differences in clonal success among the treatments: the two parasite treatments differed from the control treatment and from each other. Additionally, we measured the clone-specific population carrying capacity, competitive ability against tester clones, and reproductive success of infected and uninfected females to test whether they correlate with clonal success in the microcosms. The clone-specific competitive ability was a good predictor of clonal success in the microcosms, but clonal carrying capacity and host reproductive success were not. Our study shows that parasitemediated selection can strongly alter the outcome of clonal competition. The results suggest that parasites may influence microevolution in Daphnia populations during periods of asexual reproduction.},

We used the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial microparasite Pasteuria ramosa to study genetic variation for host susceptibility and parasite infectivity within each of two populations. We sought to answer the following questions: Do host clones differ in their susceptibility to parasite isolates? Do parasite isolates differ in their ability to infect different host clones? Are there host clone-parasite isolate interactions? The analysis revealed considerable variation in both host resistance and parasite infectivity. There were significant host clone-parasite isolate interactions, such that there was no single host clone that was superior to all other clones in the resistance to every parasite isolate. Likewise, there was no parasite isolate that was superior to all other isolates in infectivity to every host clone. This form of host clone-parasite isolate interaction indicates the potential for coevolution based on frequency-dependent selection. Infection success of original host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were isolated together) was significantly higher than infection success of novel host clone-parasite isolate combinations (i.e., those combinations that were created in the laboratory). This finding is consistent with the idea that parasites track specific host genotypes under natural conditions. In addition, correspondence analysis revealed that some host clones, although distinguishable with neutral genetic markers, were susceptible to the same set of parasite isolates and thus probably shared resistance genes.},

Both cyclical and stochastic environments are considered. It is shown that temporal variation in the linkage disequilibrium coefficientfor the pair of selected loci, due to fluctuations in the selective values of the genotypes at these loci, can give rise to selection in favor of modifier genes increasing recombination. The equilibrium level of recombination established in a given population depends on several factors; it is highest for intermediate values of the environmental periodicity or autocorrelation, for cases when the modifier genes are themselves closely linked to the selected loci, and for high levels of environmental variation. In general, it seems that the rate of modification of recombination values by this process will be low except when the modifiers are tightly linked to the selected loci. The possible evolutionary significance of this process is discussed in relation to observations on genetic systems of plants and animals.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological dynamics depend on the traits of hosts and parasites, but hosts and parasites are heterogeneous entities that exist in dynamic environments. Resource availability is a particularly dynamic and potent environmental driver of within-host infection dynamics (temporal patterns of growth, reproduction, parasite production and survival). We developed, parameterised and validated a model for resource-explicit infection dynamics by incorporating a parasitism module into dynamic energy budget theory. The model mechanistically explained the dynamic multivariate responses of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni and its intermediate host snail to variation in resources and host density. At the population level, feedbacks mediated by resource competition could create a unimodal relationship between snail density and human risk of exposure to schistosomes. Consequently, weak snail control could backfire if reductions in snail density release remaining hosts from resource competition. If resource competition is strong and relevant to schistosome production in nature, it could inform control strategies.},

  abstract = {In general, analysis of population dynamics can proceed either prospectively or retrospectively. In the case of the former, asymptotic expectations are generally derived (analytically or numerically) from analysis of the potential effects of perturbation of the elements of the life table. However, the vital rates that are indicated by prospective analysis to contribute the most to projected growth rate are not necessarily those that have contributed to observed variation in growth rate over time. We used a retrospective analysis to analyze the life table responses of a population of long-lived herbivorous geese to a systematic reduction in food abundance within the traditional breeding colony. Typical of long-lived species, adult survival rate has been shown previously in a prospective perturbation analysis to have the largest potential impact on projected growth of the population. However, despite a significant long-term increase in adult survival over the course of the study, there has been a long-term decline in growth rates of the population inhabiting the traditional sampling areas, although absolute numbers of individuals in both populations increased over time. Retrospective assessment of the relative contributions of variation in underlying vital rates (adult and juvenile survival, in situ recruitment, emigration and immigration rates into the population) to projected growth showed that the long-term dynamics of the nesting population primarily reflected the combined effects of changes in postfledging juvenile survival, while changes in the postnesting population were most influenced by variation in juvenile survival and adult fidelity rate to the traditional brood-rearing areas. Decreases in both juvenile survival and fidelity reflect systematic reductions in food abundance over the course of the study. Our results confirm previous suggestions that philopatry to the brood-rearing areas may be a significantly more plastic trait than fidelity to nesting areas.},

Despite the appeal of this idea, it has been difficult to explain how macromolecular RNAs emerged from small molecules available on the early Earth. We propose here a mechanism by which mutual catalysis in a pre-biotic network initiated a progression of stages characterized by ever larger and more effective catalysts supporting a proto-metabolic network, and the emergence of RNA as the dominant macromolecule due to its ability to both catalyze chemical reactions and to be copied in a template-directed manner. This model suggests that many features of modern life, including the biosynthetic pathways leading to simple metabolites, the structures of organic and metal ion cofactors, homochirality, and template-directed replication of nucleic acids, arose long before the RNA World and were retained as pre-biotic systems became more sophisticated.},

A handful of commercial and freely available software programs exist for fragment analysis; however, most of them are platform dependent and lack high-throughput applicability.
Results: We present the R package Fragman to serve as a freely available and platform independent resource for automatic scoring of DNA fragment lengths diversity panels and biparental populations. The program analyzes DNA fragment lengths generated in Applied Biosystems\textregistered{} (ABI) either manually or automatically by providing panels or bins. The package contains additional tools for converting the allele calls to GenAlEx, JoinMap\textregistered{} and OneMap software formats mainly used for genetic diversity and generating linkage maps in plant and animal populations. Easy plotting functions and multiplexing friendly capabilities are some of the strengths of this R package. Fragment analysis using a unique set of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) genotypes based on microsatellite markers is used to highlight the capabilities of Fragman.
Conclusion: Fragman is a valuable new tool for genetic analysis. The package produces equivalent results to other popular software for fragment analysis while possessing unique advantages and the possibility of automation for high-throughput experiments by exploiting the power of R.},

  abstract = {One explanation for the widespread abundance of sexual reproduction is the advantage that genetically diverse sexual lineages have under strong pressure from virulent coevolving parasites. Such parasites are believed to track common asexual host genotypes, resulting in negative frequencydependent selection that counterbalances the population growth-rate advantage of asexuals in comparison with sexuals. In the face of genetically diverse asexual lineages, this advantage of sexual reproduction might be eroded, and instead sexual populations would be replaced by diverse assemblages of clonal lineages. We investigated whether parasite-mediated selection promotes clonal diversity in 22 natural populations of the freshwater snail Melanoides tuberculata. We found that infection prevalence explains the observed variation in the clonal diversity of M. tuberculata populations, whereas no such relationship was found between infection prevalence and male frequency. Clonal diversity and male frequency were independent of snail population density. Incorporating ecological factors such as presence/ absence of fish, habitat geography and habitat type did not improve the predictive power of regression models. Approximately 11\% of the clonal snail genotypes were shared among 2\textendash{}4 populations, creating a web of 17 interconnected populations. Taken together, our study suggests that parasitemediated selection coupled with host dispersal ecology promotes clonal diversity. This, in return, may erode the advantage of sexual reproduction in M. tuberculata populations.},

  abstract = {Although it is well established theoretically that selective interference among mutations (Hill\textendash{}Robertson interference) favours meiotic recombination, genomewide mean rates of mutation and strengths of selection appear too low to support this as the mechanism favouring recombination in nature. A possible solution to this discrepancy between theory and observation is that selection is at least intermittently very strong due to the antagonistic coevolution between a host and its parasites. The Red Queen theory posits that such coevolution generates fitness epistasis among loci, which generates negative linkage disequilibrium among beneficial mutations, which in turn favours recombination. This theory has received only limited support. However, Red Queen dynamics without epistasis may provide the ecological conditions that maintain strong and frequent selective interference in finite populations that indirectly selects for recombination. This hypothesis is developed here through the simulation of Red Queen dynamics. This approach required the development of a method to calculate the exact frequencies of multilocus haplotypes after recombination. Simulations show that recombination is favoured by the moderately weak selection of many loci involved in the interaction between a host and its parasites, which results in substitution rates that are compatible with empirical estimates. The model also reproduces the previously reported rapid increase in the rate of outcrossing in Caenorhabditis elegans coevolving with a bacterial pathogen.},

We examine a situation in which hosts upon being infected can mount a defensive response to clear the infection, but in which there is a fecundity cost to such immunological up-regulation. We also suppose that the parasite exploits the host and thereby causes an elevated host mortality rate. We determine the coevolutionary stable strategies of the parasite's level of exploitation and the host's level of up-regulation, and illustrate the patterns of reduced host fitness (i.e., virulence) that these produce. We find that counterintuitive patterns of virulence are often expected to arise as a result of the interaction between coevolved host and parasite strategies. In particular, despite the fact that the parasite imposes only a mortality cost on the host, coevolution by the host results in a pattern whereby infected hosts always have the same probability of death from infection, but they vary in the extent to which their fecundity is reduced. This contrasts with previous results and arises from our inclusion of two important factors absent from previous theory: costs of immunological up-regulation and a more suitable measure of parasite-induced mortality.},

  abstract = {On April 27, 1980, the Greek freighter "Anangel Liberty" went aground on the reef at French Frigate Shoals, a National Wildlife Refuge in the Hawaiian Islands. The vessel was refloated with no major damage or fuel spillage after 2 200 tons (2 200 000 kg) of koalin cargo had been jettisoned on the reef. Huge plumes of suspended clay raised major concern over the possibility of widespread ecological damage. However, field investigations conducted 14 d after the kaolin was dumped revealed that environmental impact was very minor and highly localized; it was evident that most of the kaolin had been suspended and removed from the area. The only significant damage was a 2 to 3 m deep channel plowed through Lhe reef by the freighter. Within 50 m of both sides of the channel, some coral was smothered and colonies of Pocillopora spp. were alive but slightly bleached. Beyond 50 m there were no apparent impact, nor did any clay settle on the bottom. This incident illustrates that some events which initially appear to have potential pollutant impact do not produce significant and irreversible environmental changes and emphasizes the need to analyze such events on a case-by-case basis.},

  abstract = {Viability analyses of large metapopulations are often hampered by difficulties in the parameter estimation. This leads to high uncertainty in parameter values and model outputs and complicates the formulation of clear recommendations for conservation management. We present a comprehensive procedure that is able to process spatiotemporal patterns of metapopulation occupancy to rank management scenarios. The first step of the procedure involves the formulation of the stochastic metapopulation model and the estimation of parameter values with a Bayesian approach, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second step, the model is used to predict the effects of different management actions, taking into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Finally, in the third step, decision analysis is used to evaluate and aggregate the results of the previous step into a simple rank order of management scenarios. The procedure was applied to a metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary, Melitaea cinxia. Although the amount of available occupancy data was considerable, the uncertainty in the estimated model parameter values was so large that a precise estimate of the extinction risk of the metapopulation could not be made. However, the procedure was able to produce a rank order of management scenarios that was extraordinarily robust to the uncertainty. Application of the procedure to two other case studies revealed that, even though robust rankings cannot always be obtained, the results of the procedure are helpful in assessing the degree of uncertainty in the ranking and pointing to those factors most responsible for the lack of robustness. The results of this paper demonstrate very clearly, by way of example, both the limitations and the possibilities of model-based metapopulation viability analysis.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach for defining groups of populations that are geographically homogeneous and maximally differentiated from each other. As a by-product, it also leads to the identification of genetic barriers between these groups. The method is based on a simulated annealing procedure that aims to maximize the proportion of total genetic variance due to differences between groups of populations (spatial analysis of molecular variance; SAMOVA). Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the performance of our approach and, for comparison, the behaviour of the Monmonier algorithm, a procedure commonly used to identify zones of sharp genetic changes in a geographical area. Simulations showed that the SAMOVA algorithm indeed finds maximally differentiated groups, which do not always correspond to the simulated group structure in the presence of isolation by distance, especially when data from a single locus are available. In this case, the Monmonier algorithm seems slightly better at finding predefined genetic barriers, but can often lead to the definition of groups of populations not differentiated genetically. The SAMOVA algorithm was then applied to a set of European roe deer populations examined for their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) HVRI diversity. The inferred genetic structure seemed to confirm the hypothesis that some Italian populations were recently reintroduced from a Balkanic stock, as well as the differentiation of groups of populations possibly due to the postglacial recolonization of Europe or the action of a specific barrier to gene flow.},

  abstract = {Understanding the source and diversity of clones is necessary to resolve the complicated issues surrounding the apparent evolutionary stability of sexual reproduction. The source of clones is important because present theory is based on an ``all else equal'' assumption, which is predicated on the idea that clonal mutants are derived from and compete with local sexual populations. Clonal diversity is important because it reduces the advantage of sexual reproduction under either soft selection (the Tangled Bank Hypothesis) or under strict frequency-dependent selection (the Red Queen Hypothesis). In the present study, protein electrophoresis was used to determine the source and diversity of clones in a freshwater snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in four glacial lakes in which sexual and clonal females were thought to coexist. The results showed (1) that the populations were mixtures of diploid sexual and triploid asexual individuals, (2) that genotypic diversity of clonal populations is very high in all four lakes (but lower than in the sympatric sexual populations), and (3) that the clones are polyphyletically derived from their sympatric sexual populations. Consequently, repeated mutation to parthenogenetic reproduction since the Pleistocene has introduced a different and diverse set of clones in all four lakes. Such diversity may provide a challenge for the ecological theories of sex that rely on frequency-dependent selection.},

  abstract = {Pathogens have important effects on host life-history traits, but the magnitude of these effects is often strongly contextdependent. The outcome of an interaction between a host and an infectious agent is often associated with the level of stress experienced by the host. Ranavirus causes disease and mortality in amphibian populations in various locations around the world, but most known cases of ranaviral infection have occurred in North America and the United Kingdom. While Ranavirus virulence has been investigated, the outcome of Ranavirus infection has seldom been related to the host environment. In a factorial experiment, we exposed Northern leopard frog (Lithobates pipiens, formerly Rana pipiens) tadpoles to different concentrations of Ranavirus and investigated the effect of host density on certain life-history traits, namely survival, growth rate, developmental stage and number of days from virus exposure to death. Our results suggest a prominent role of density in driving the direction of the interaction between L. pipiens tadpoles and Ranavirus. We showed that increasing animal holding density is detrimental for host fitness as mortality rate is higher, day of death earlier, development longer and growth rate significantly lower in high-density tanks. We observed a linear increase of detrimental effects when Ranavirus doses increased in low-density conditions, with control tadpoles having a significantly higher overall relative fitness. However, this pattern was no longer observed in high-density conditions, where the effects of increasing Ranavirus dose were limited. Infected and control animals fitness were consequently similar. We speculate that the host may eventually diverts the energy required for a metabolic/immune response triggered by the infection (i.e., direct costs of the infection) to better cope with the increase in environmental ``stress'' associated with high density (i.e., indirect benefits of the infection). Our results illustrate how the net fitness of organisms may be shaped by ecological context and emphasize the necessity of examining the direct/indirect costs and benefits balance to fully understand host-pathogen interactions.},

Results showed significant genotype by environment interaction (G\texttimes{}E) for all traits in response to different watering regimes. For the RIL population, the observed G\texttimes{}E was reflected in 17 QTL by environment interactions (Q\texttimes{}E), while 17 additional QTLs were mapped not showing Q\texttimes{}E. GWA mapping identified 58 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) associated with loci displaying Q\texttimes{}E and an additional 16 SNPs associated with loci not showing Q\texttimes{}E. Many candidate genes potentially underlying these loci were suggested. The genes for RPS3C and YLS7 were found to contain conserved amino acid differences when comparing Arabidopsis accessions with strongly contrasting drought response phenotypes, further supporting their candidacy. One of these candidate genes co-located with a QTL mapped in the RIL population.},

Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the phylum is highly divergent and that some lineages show strong associations with host taxa.

Four novel microsporidian parasite sequences were detected within populations of three host species from the genera Bulinus, Biomphalaria and Planorbis. Prevalence ranged from 5 to 84\%. Phylogenetic analysis of these novel sequences reveals that they group together as a paraphyletic assemblage in the microsporidian tree basal to the two lineages containing the genera Encephalitozoon and Nosema. Preliminary observation of one microsporidian infection, show parasites distributed in all tissue systems of Bulinus globosus. However, infection is most prevalent in the digestive gland while also in the egg sacs, suggesting that the microsporidium is using a mixed strategy of horizontal and vertical transmission in this population.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes{\~O} Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

By means of a mathematical model, I investigate the coevolutionary dynamics arising from a large set of generalized models of infection genetics in which hosts are either fully resistant or fully susceptible to a parasite, depending on the genotype of both individuals. With a single diploid interaction locus in the hosts, many of the infection genetic models produce stable or neutrally stable genotype polymorphisms. However, only a few models, which are all different versions of the matching-allele model, lead to sustained cycles of genotype frequency fluctuations in both interacting species (``Red Queen'' dynamics). By contrast, with two diploid interaction loci in the hosts, many infection genetics models that cannot be classified as one of the standard infection genetics models produce Red Queen dynamics. Sexual versus asexual reproduction and, in the former case, the rate of recombination between the interaction loci have a large impact on whether Red Queen dynamics arise from a given infection genetics model. This may have interesting but as yet unexplored implications with respect to the Red Queen hypothesis for the evolution of sex.},

Here we present a Bayesian analysis of species-abundance data that yields a full joint probability distribution of each model's parameters plus a relatively parameter-independent criterion, the posterior Bayes factor, to compare these models. We illustrate our approach by comparing three classical distributions: the zero-sum multinomial (ZSM) distribution, based on Hubbell's neutral model, the multivariate Poisson lognormal distribution (MPLN), based on niche arguments, and the discrete broken stick (DBS) distribution, based on MacArthur's broken stick model. We give explicit formulas for the probability of observing a particular species-abundance data set in each model, and argue that conditioning on both sample size and species count is needed to allow comparisons between the two distributions. We apply our approach to two neotropical communities (trees, fish). We find that DBS is largely inferior to ZSM and MPLN for both communities. The tree data do not allow discrimination between ZSM and MPLN, but for the fish data ZSM (neutral model) overwhelmingly outperforms MPLN (niche model), suggesting that dispersal plays a previously underestimated role in structuring tropical freshwater fish communities. We advocate this approach for identifying the relative importance of dispersal and niche-partitioning in determining diversity of different ecological groups of species under different environmental conditions.},

Its study often relies on microparasitic infections introducing a potential bias in the estimation of the evolutionary change of host and parasite traits. Using biological invasions as a tool to study host\textendash{}parasite coevolution in nature can overcome these biases. We demonstrate this with a cross-infection experiment in the invasive macroparasite Mytilicola intestinalis and its bivalve host, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The invasion history of the parasite is well known for the southeastern North Sea and is characterised by two separate invasion fronts that reached opposite ends of the Wadden Sea (i.e. Texel, The Netherlands and Sylt, Germany) in a similar time frame. The species' natural history thus makes this invasion an ideal natural experiment to study host\textendash{}parasite coevolution in nature. We infected hosts from Texel, Sylt and Kiel (Baltic Sea, where the parasite is absent) with parasites from Texel and Sylt, to form sympatric, allopatric and na{\"i}ve infestation combinations, respectively. We measured infection rate, host condition and parasite growth to show that sympatric host\textendash{}parasite combinations diverged in terms of pre- and post-infection traits within {$<$}100 generations since their introduction. Texel parasites were more infective and more efficient at exploiting the host's resources. Hosts on Texel, on the other hand, evolved resistance to infection, whereas hosts on Sylt may have evolved tolerance. This illustrates that different coevolutionary trajectories can evolve along separate invasion fronts of the parasite, highlighting the use of biological invasions in studies of host\textendash{}parasite coevolution in nature.},

Such functions have been used to study the evolution of virulence and to explore the possibility of a conflict between natural selection at individual and population levels for directly transmitted diseases (Gilchrist and Coombs, 2006). In this paper, a new coupled model for environmentally-driven diseases is analyzed to study similar biological questions. It extends the model in Cen et al. (2014) and Feng et al. (2013) by including the disease-induced host mortality. It is shown that the extended model exhibits similar dynamical behaviors including the possible occurrence of a backward bifurcation. It is also shown that the within-host pathogen load and the disease prevalence at the positive stable equilibrium are increasing functions of the within- and between-host reproduction numbers (Rw0 and Rb0), respectively. Optimal parasite strategies will maximize these reproduction numbers at the two levels, and a conflict may exist between the two levels. Our results highlight the role of inter-dependence of variables and parameters in the fast and slow systems for persistence of infections and evolution of pathogens in an environmentally-driven disease. Our results also demonstrate the importance of incorporating explicit links of the within- and between-host dynamics into the computation of threshold conditions for disease control.},

Next-generation sequencing methods allow us to reconsider previous ideas and conclusions concerning the distribution of genetic variation, and what this distribution implies about a given species evolutionary history. A previous phylogeographic study of the crustacean Daphnia magna suggested that, despite strong genetic differentiation among populations at a local scale, the species shows only moderate genetic structure across its European range, with a spatially patchy occurrence of individual lineages. We apply RAD sequencing to a sample of D. magna collected across a wide swath of the species' Eurasian range and analyse the data using principle component analysis (PCA) of genetic variation and Procrustes analytical approaches, to quantify spatial genetic structure. We find remarkable consistency between the first two PCA axes and the geographic coordinates of individual sampling points, suggesting that, on a continent-wide scale, genetic differentiation is driven to a large extent by geographic distance. The observed pattern is consistent with unimpeded (i.e. no barriers, landscape or otherwise) migration at large spatial scales, despite the fragmented and patchy nature of favourable habitats at local scales. With high-resolution genetic data similar patterns may be uncovered for other species with wide geographic distributions, allowing an increased understanding of how genetic drift and selection have shaped their evolutionary history.},

We first describe instances of single water mite species that are ectoparasitic on different species of host dragonflies, where the mites are killed by resistance mechanisms and have little to no fitness on some host species. This begs the question of why some host species are susceptible, whereas other host species are (nearly) completely resistant. Earlier logic based on parasites exploiting abundant host species at the cost of exploiting rare host species does not explain such instances well. Rather, a hypothesis based on closed populations of some host species being able to evolve parasite recognition is invoked. Parasite recognition is not expected to evolve in host species from more open populations with considerable gene flow across sites, only some sites of which have the parasite species present. The logic of this hypothesis can be explored with simulation models, whereas empirical tests could involve combined approaches using molecular genetics, population genetics, experimental infections and transplantation experiments.},

Despite being computational, these programs evolve quickly in an open-ended way, and starting from only one or two ancestral organisms, the formation of ecological networks can be observed in real-time by tracking interactions between the constantly evolving organism phenotypes. These phenotypes may be defined by combinations of logical computations (hereafter tasks) that digital organisms perform and by expressed behaviors that have evolved. The types and outcomes of interactions between phenotypes are determined by task overlap for logicdefined phenotypes and by responses to encounters in the case of behavioral phenotypes. Biologists use these evolving networks to study active and fundamental topics within evolutionary ecology (e.g., the extent to which the architecture of multispecies networks shape coevolutionary outcomes, and the processes involved).},

However, aggregate properties of polymorphism, such as altelic diversity or the frequency of resistance, may be relatively easy to work with. I study this problem with computer simulations of a host-parasite model. In one example, the simulations show that the allelic diversity at a locus is similar in a host-parasite model and a neutral model in which drift is the only evolutionary process. A1Mic diversity is similar in the two models, even though the temporal dynamics of individual allele frequencies are very different. In a second example, the genetic system that would be inferred from analysing samples of hosts and parasites is quite different from the actual specificity that determines the dynamics of the system. Thus, general conclusions about the specificity of host-parasite genetics must be analysed in the context of the expected statistical distributions of polymorphism. The final example shows that the frequency of resistance provides an interesting aggregate measure of host-parasite polymorphism. If the ratio of parasite generation time to the time between the reproductive seasons of the hosts is small, then no regular periodicity in the frequency of resistance occurs. However, if parasites haw\textasciitilde{} many generations per reproductive season of the host, then resistance fluctuates with a period equal to the seasonality of the host. The important role of seasonality shown here differs from the emphasis in previous theories on the relative generation times of host and parasite.},

We argue that a very common measurement scale is linear at small magnitudes grading into logarithmic at large magnitudes, leading to observations that often follow Student's probability distribution which has a Gaussian shape for small fluctuations from the mean and a power law shape for large fluctuations from the mean. An inverse scaling often arises in which measures naturally grade from logarithmic to linear as one moves from small to large magnitudes, leading to observations that often follow a gamma probability distribution. A gamma distribution has a power law shape for small magnitudes and an exponential shape for large magnitudes. The two measurement scales are natural inverses connected by the Laplace integral transform. This inversion connects the two major scaling patterns commonly found in nature. We also show that superstatistics is a special case of an integral transform, and thus can be understood as a particular way in which to change the scale of measurement. Incorporating information about measurement scale into maximum entropy provides a general approach to the relations between measurement, information and probability.},

  abstract = {Commonly observed patterns typically follow a few distinct families of probability distributions. Over one hundred years ago, Karl Pearson provided a systematic derivation and classification of the common continuous distributions. His approach was phenomenological: a differential equation that generated common distributions without any underlying conceptual basis for why common distributions have particular forms and what explains the familial relations. Pearson's system and its descendants remain the most popular systematic classification of probability distributions. Here, we unify the disparate forms of common distributions into a single system based on two meaningful and justifiable propositions. First, distributions follow maximum entropy subject to constraints, where maximum entropy is equivalent to minimum information. Second, different problems associate magnitude to information in different ways, an association we describe in terms of the relation between information invariance and measurement scale. Our framework relates the different continuous probability distributions through the variations in measurement scale that change each family of maximum entropy distributions into a distinct family. From our framework, future work in biology can consider the genesis of common patterns in a new and more general way. Particular biological processes set the relation between the information in observations and magnitude, the basis for information invariance, symmetry and measurement scale. The measurement scale, in turn, determines the most likely probability distributions and observed patterns associated with particular processes. This view presents a fundamentally derived alternative to the largely unproductive debates about neutrality in ecology and evolution.},

  abstract = {The consistency of the species abundance distribution across diverse communities has attracted widespread attention. In this paper, I argue that the consistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a common symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that different ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and lose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame these explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a recently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the natural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear: the information in observations at small population sizes scales logarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information grades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a gamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed patterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the magnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear. This measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic diversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in biology.},

  abstract = {Understanding the selective forces influencing genetic diversity is a fundamental goal of evolutionary ecology. The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a key role in the adaptive immune response of vertebrates and thus provide an excellent opportunity to examine the agents of selection on a functionally important gene. Here we examine the genetic architecture of the MHC class IIB genes in 10 wild populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in Northern Trinidad. We have previously shown that these populations are significantly less diverged at the class IIB locus than expected based on neutral (microsatellite) loci. We now survey infection by Gyrodactylus turnbulli and G. bullatarudis, common parasitic worms that infect guppies, as a potential agent of homogenizing selection. We used a genetic algorithm to partition both additive and non-additive genetic effects of the five most common MHC allele types as well as a rare allele category. Although we found no evidence for non-additive effects, across the populations we found that one allele type (the a-type) had a significant negative additive effect on parasite load. Thus, individuals who had more copies of the a-type allele were infected with fewer gyrodactylus than individuals with fewer copies of the allele. These results not only link parasite infection with MHC genotype, they provide a mechanism of homogenizing selection across these otherwise disparate populations.},

The interaction between antagonists initially resulted in arms race dynamics (ARD) with selective sweeps, causing oscillating host\textendash{}virus population dynamics. However, ARD ended and populations stabilised after the evolution of a general resistant host, whereas a trade-off between host resistance and growth then maintained host diversity over time (trade-off driven dynamics). Most importantly, our study shows that the interaction between ecology and evolution had important consequences for the predictability of the mode and tempo of adaptive change and for the stability and adaptive potential of populations.},

Most of these studies revealed a local adaptation of the parasite. In several cases, however, parasites were found to be locally maladapted or neither adapted nor maladapted. In the present paper, we try to determine the causes of such variability in these results. We analyse a host\textendash{}parasite metapopulation model and study the effect of several factors on the emergence of local adaptation: population sizes, mutation rates and migration rates for both the host and the parasite, and parasite generation time. We show that all these factors may act on local adaptation through their effects on the evolutionary potential of each species. In particular, we find that higher numbers of mutants or migrants do, in general, promote local adaptation. Interestingly, shorter parasite generation time does not always favour parasite local adaptation. When genetic variability is limiting, shorter generation time, via an increase of the strength of selection, decreases the capacity of the parasite to adapt to an evolving host.},

We found strong support for the hypothesis that the host migrates more than its parasite. Hosts colonized artificial tree holes in the field at a much higher rate than the parasite. Field releases of the parasite demonstrated that it colonizes and persists in natural tree holes where it was previously absent, suggesting that parasite distribution is limited by its migratory ability. Although the host migrates more than its parasite, we found no evidence for local adaptation by hosts and some evidence for local adaptation by parasites. Other life history traits of the host and parasite may also influence patterns in local adaptation, particularly parasite virulence and host dormancy.},

In Daphnia hyalina, the distances between setulae increase from 0.3-0.4 gm in small juveniles, to 0.8-2.0 gm in adults. In Daphnia magna, the mesh-size of the filter does not increase significantly with growth. There is good evidence that the relative abundance of the filter-feeding types varies with the trophic state of the lake. In oligotrophic lakes the "coarse mesh filter-feeders" usually dominate throughout the year. The seasonal succession of zooplankton species in eutrophic lakes can be interpreted as a succession of feeding types; during winter "coarse mesh filterfeeders" dominate, while "fine mesh filter-feeders" are most abundant during summer phytoplankton blooms. Our results support the hypothesis that the species composition of filterfeeding zooplankton is strongly influenced by the amount of suspended bacteria which are available as food only for filterfeeding species with fine meshes.},

Previous work on the geographic mosaic of coevolution has shown that coevolution depends on the spatial structure, the strength of selection, and gene flow across populations. We used spatial subgraphs and coevolutionary models to evaluate how spatial structure and the location of coevolutionary hotspots (sites in which reciprocal selection occurs) and coldspots (sites in which unidirectional selection occurs) contribute to the dynamics of coevolution and the maintenance of polymorphisms. Specifically, we developed a new approach based on the Laplacian matrices of spatial subgraphs to explore the tendency of interacting species to evolve toward stable polymorphisms. Despite the complex interplay between gene flow and the strength of reciprocal selection, simple rules drive coevolution in small groups of spatially structured interacting populations. Hotspot location and the spatial organization of coldspots are crucial for understanding patterns in the maintenance of polymorphisms. Moreover, the degree of spatial variation in the outcomes of the coevolutionary process can be predicted from the network pattern of gene flow among sites. Our work provides us with novel tools that can be used in the field or the laboratory to predict the effects of spatial structure on coevolutionary trajectories.},

Instruction in coevolution is therefore an excellent way to teach students evolutionary principles.

Students collaborate to collect data on the change in frequency of host and parasite genotypes (card suits) through time. They use these data to conduct an independent test of the prediction that hostparasite coevolution maintains genetic variation. The game is suitable for students ranging from upper-level high school through college. We include detailed instructions, discussion topics, and simple modifications to extend the game to additional topics.

Under this hypothesis, coevolving parasites favour sexual reproduction by adapting to infect common asexual clones and driving them down in frequency. One limitation, however, seems to challenge the generality of the Red Queen: in theoretical models, parasites must be very virulent to maintain sex. Moreover, experiments show virulence to be unstable, readily shifting in response to environmental conditions. Does variation in virulence further limit the ability of coevolving parasites to maintain sex? To address this question, we simulated temporal variation in virulence and evaluated the outcome of competition between sexual and asexual females. We found that variation in virulence did not limit the ability of coevolving parasites to maintain sex. In fact, relatively high variation in virulence promoted parasite-mediated maintenance of sex. With sufficient variation, sexual females persisted even when mean virulence fell well below the threshold virulence required to maintain sex under constant conditions. We conclude that natural variation in virulence does not limit the relevance of the Red Queen hypothesis for natural populations; on the contrary, it could expand the range of conditions over which coevolving parasites can maintain sex.},

Importantly, the multicopy nature of this region allows the amplification of low-quantity samples of the target DNA, a common problem in studies on unicellular, unculturable microparasites. We analysed ITS sequences from the protozoan parasite Caullerya mesnili (class Ichthyosporea) infecting waterflea (Daphnia) hosts, across several host population samples. We showed that analysing representative ITS-types [as identified by statistical parsimony network analysis (SPN)] is a suitable method to address relevant polymorphism. The spatial patterns were consistent regardless of whether parasite DNA was extracted from individual hosts or pooled host samples. Remarkably, the efficiency in detecting different sequence types was even higher after sample pooling. As shown by simulations, an easily manageable number of sequences from pooled DNA samples are sufficient to resolve the spatial population structure in this system. In summary, the ITS region analysed from pooled DNA samples can provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of microparasites. Moreover, the application of SPN analysis is a good alternative to the well-established neighbour-joining method (NJ) for the identification of representative ITS-types. SPN can even outperform NJ by joining most of the singleton sequences to representative sequence clusters.},

Thus, for moderate to large e/c-values, regional abundance grows with the heterogeneity of the network, with uniform or random networks having the lowest regional abundances, and scale-free networks having the largest abundance. However, the ranking is reversed for low extinction probabilities, with heterogeneous networks showing the lowest relative abundance. We further explore the mechanisms underlying such results by relating a node's incidence (average number of time steps the node is occupied) with its degree, and with the average degree of the nodes it interacts with. These results demonstrate the importance of spatial network structure to understanding metapopulation abundance, and serve to determine under what circumstances information on network structure should be complemented with information on the species life-history traits to understand persistence in heterogeneous environments. \& 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Many factors may influence the structure of invertebrate communities. Among these is the presence of parasites which attack some or all members of a guild and potentially promote coexistence of competitor species. We assessed the prevalence of nematode (Allantonematidae) parasitism in Dutch woodland drosophilids (Diptera). Nematodes were found in 6 of the 18 drosophilid species sampled (percentage parasitism in parentheses): Drosophila phalerata (16\%), D. kuntzei (5.1\%), D. immigrans (0.5\%), D. testacea (1.2\%) and D. transversa (2.8\%) were all parasitized by Howardula aoronymphium and D. subobscura (3\%) was parasitized by Parazitylenchus diplogenus. This is the first report of nematode parasitism of D. immigrans and D. transversa. There were no important seasonal trends in percentage parasitism. We explored the consequences of nematode parasitism for individual drosophilids. Nematodes did not exert an important influence on the wing length (adult body size) of the drosophilids we sampled, but egg loads (fecundities) of female D. phalerata, D. subobscura and D. kuntzei were reduced by nematode parasitism. Parasitism rates were positively correlated with relative host abundance, in Dutch and other communities, suggesting that species diversity is promoted by a disproportionately high parasitism of more common host species.},

This belief is founded on previous theoretical work, which assumes infinite or constant population size. To what extent are such sustained oscillations realistic?
Results: Here, we use a related mathematical modeling approach to demonstrate that ongoing Red Queen dynamics is unlikely. In fact, they collapse rapidly when two critical pieces of realism are acknowledged: (i) population size fluctuations, caused by the antagonism of the interaction in concordance with the Lotka-Volterra relationship; and (ii) stochasticity, acting in any finite population. Together, these two factors cause fast allele fixation. Fixation is not restricted to common alleles, as expected from drift, but also seen for originally rare alleles under a wide parameter space, potentially facilitating spread of novel variants.
Conclusion: Our results call for a paradigm shift in our understanding of host-parasite coevolution, strongly suggesting that these are driven by recurrent selective sweeps rather than continuous allele oscillations.},

Some field studies have reported that host genotype frequencies in natural populations change over time according to parasite-driven negative frequency-dependent selection. However, the temporal patterns of parasite genotypes have rarely been investigated. Moreover, parasite-driven negative frequency-dependent selection is contingent on the existence of genetic specificity between hosts and parasites. In the present study, the population dynamics and host-genotype specificity of the ichthyosporean Caullerya mesnili, a common endoparasite of Daphnia water fleas, were analysed based on the observed sequence variation in the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. The Daphnia population of lake Greifensee (Switzerland) was sampled and subjected to parasite screening and host genotyping during C. mesnili epidemics of four consecutive years. The ITS1 of wild-caught C. mesnili-infected Daphnia was sequenced using the 454 pyrosequencing platform. The relative frequencies of C. mesnili ITS1 sequences differed significantly among years: the most abundant C. mesnili ITS1 sequence decreased and rare sequences increased over the course of the study, a pattern consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection. However, only a weak signal of host-genotype specificity between C. mesnili and Daphnia genotypes was detected. Use of cutting edge genomic techniques will allow further investigation of the underlying micro-evolutionary relationships within the Daphnia\textendash{}C. mesnili system.},

  abstract = {As researchers collect spatiotemporal population and genetic data in tandem, models that connect demography and dispersal to genetics are increasingly relevant. The dominant spatiotemporal model of invasion genetics is the stepping-stone model which represents a gradual range expansion in which individuals jump to uncolonized locations one step at a time. However, many range expansions occur quickly as individuals disperse far from currently colonized regions. For these types of expansion, stepping-stone models are inappropriate. To more accurately reflect wider dispersal in many organisms, we created kernel-based models of invasion genetics based on integrodifference equations. Classic theory relating to integrodifference equations suggests that the speed of range expansions is a function of population growth and dispersal. In our simulations, populations that expanded at the same speed but with spread rates driven by dispersal retained more heterozygosity along axes of expansion than range expansions with rates of spread that were driven primarily by population growth. To investigate surfing we introduced mutant alleles in wave fronts of simulated range expansions. In our models based on random mating, surfing alleles remained at relatively low frequencies and surfed less often compared to previous results based on stepping-stone simulations with asexual reproduction.},

  abstract = {The process of disease transmission is determined by the interaction of host susceptibility and exposure to parasite infectious stages. Host behavior is an important determinant of the likelihood of exposure to infectious stages but is difficult to measure and often assumed to be homogenous in models of disease spread. We evaluated the importance of precisely defining host contact when using networks that estimate exposure and predict infection prevalence in a replicated, empirical system. In particular, we hypothesized that infection patterns would be predicted only by a contact network that is defined according to host behavior and parasite life cycle. Two competing host contact criteria were used to construct networks defined by parasite life cycle and social contacts. First, parasite-defined contacts were based on shared space with a time delay corresponding to the environmental development time of nematode parasites with a direct fecal\textendash{}oral life cycle. Second, social contacts were defined by shared space in the same time period. To quantify the competing networks of exposure and infection, we sampled natural populations of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and infection of their gastrointestinal helminth community using replicated longitudinal capture\textendash{}mark\textendash{}recapture techniques. We predicted that (1) infection with parasites with direct fecal\textendash{}oral life cycles would be explained by the time delay contact network, but not the social contact network; (2) infection with parasites with trophic life cycles (via a mobile intermediate host; thus, spatially decoupling transmission from host contact) would not be explained by either contact network. The prevalence of fecal\textendash{}oral life cycle nematode parasites was strongly correlated to the number and strength of network connections from the parasite-defined network (including the time delay), while the prevalence of trophic life cycle parasites was not correlated with any network metrics. We concluded that incorporating the parasite life cycle, relative to the way that exposure is measured, is key to inferring transmission and can be empirically quantified using network techniques. In addition, appropriately defining and measuring contacts according the life history of the parasite and relevant behaviors of the host is a crucial step in applying network analyses to empirical systems.},

  abstract = {A rich body of theory on the evolution of virulence (disease severity) attempts to predict the conditions that cause parasites to harm their hosts, and a central assumption to many of these models is that the relative virulence of pathogen strains is stable across a range of host types. In contrast, a largely nonoverlapping body of theory on coevolution assumes that the fitness effects of parasites on hosts is not stable across host genotype, but instead depends on host genotype by parasite genotype interactions. If such genetic interactions largely determine virulence, it becomes difficult to predict the strength and direction of selection on virulence. In this study, we tested for host-by-parasite interactions in a medically relevant vertebrate disease model: the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice. We found that parasite and particularly host main effects explained most of the variance in virulence (anaemia and weight loss), resistance (parasite burden) and transmission potential. Hostby-parasite interactions were of limited influence, but nevertheless had significant effects. This raises the possibility that host heterogeneity may affect the rate of any parasite response to selection on virulence. This study of rodent malaria is one of the first tests for host-by-parasite interactions in any vertebrate disease; host-by-parasite interactions typical of those assumed in coevolutionary models were present, but were by no means pervasive.},

It is now generally accepted that the facultative bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum is implicated in its resistance to the parasitoid Aphidius ervi. It has also been shown that heat negatively affects pea aphid resistance, suggesting the thermosensitivity of its defensive symbiosis. Here we examined the effects of heat and UV-B on the resistance of A. pisum to A. ervi and we relate its stability under heat stress to different facultative bacterial symbionts hosted by the aphid. For six A. pisum clones harboring four different facultative symbiont associations, the impact of heat and UV-B was measured on their ability to resist A. ervi parasitism under controlled conditions. The results revealed that temperature strongly affected resistance, while UV-B did not. As previously shown, highly resistant A. pisum clones singly infected with H. defensa became more susceptible to parasitism after exposure to heat. Interestingly, clones that were superinfected with H. defensa in association with a newly discovered facultative symbiont, referred to as PAXS (pea aphid X-type symbiont), not only remained highly resistant under heat stress, but also expressed previously unknown, very precocious resistance to A. ervi compared to clones with H. defensa alone. The prevalence of dual symbiosis involving PAXS and H. defensa in local aphid populations suggests its importance in protecting aphid immunity to parasitoids under abiotic stress.},

We combined a model for trait evolution with data for twenty plant-animal assemblages to explore coevolution in mutualistic networks. The results revealed three fundamental aspects of coevolution in species-rich mutualisms. First, coevolution shapes species traits throughout mutualistic networks by speeding up the overall rate of evolution. Second, coevolution results in higher trait complementarity in interacting partners and trait convergence in species in the same trophic level. Third, convergence is higher in the presence of super-generalists, which are species that interact with multiple groups of species. We predict that worldwide shifts in the occurrence of super-generalists will alter how coevolution shapes webs of interacting species. Introduced species such as honeybees will favour trait convergence in invaded communities, whereas the loss of large frugivores will lead to increased trait dissimilarity in tropical ecosystems.},

Population crashes occurring approxim ately every 3 years are prim arily due to winter food shortage. In this paper we show that sheep experimentally relieved of their gastrointestinal nem atodes (predom inantly Teladorsagia spp.) survived a crash better than m atched controls, showing that nem atode parasites contribute to the probability that a sheep dies in a crash. We also show that over three successive crashes m ortality was significantly different between individuals of the three different genotypes at the diallelic adenosine deaminase locus (Ada). FF animals were most likely to die, SS anim als had an interm ediate probability of dying, and FS anim als were least likely to die. Finally, three independent lines of evidence suggest that nem atode burdens differ between the three A da genotypes. First, in August, heterozygous females are less likely to have nem atode eggs in their faeces than homozygous females. Second, at lambing, the periparturient rise in faecal egg count was highest in homozygous FF individuals. Finally, during the A utum n m ating season, heterozygous males has lower faecal egg counts than homozgyotes, although this relation was complicated by interactions with year and age of male. These results are consistent with the idea that Ada allele frequencies are m aintained in the sheep population by parasite-associated selection.},

However, disease ecology has only begun to integrate interactions between hosts and their food resources (foraging ecology) despite that hosts often encounter their parasites while feeding. A zooplankton\textendash{}fungal system illustrated this central connection between foraging and transmission. Using experiments that varied food density for Daphnia hosts, density of fungal spores and body size of Daphnia, we produced mechanistic yet general models for disease transmission rate based on broadly applicable components of feeding biology. Best performing models could explain why prevalence of infection declined at high food density and rose sharply as host size increased (a pattern echoed in nature). In comparison, the classic mass-action model for transmission performed quite poorly. These foraging-based models should broadly apply to systems in which hosts encounter parasites while eating, and they will catalyse future integration of the roles of Daphnia as grazer and host.},

We attribute this effect to increasing costs of generalism for phages and bacteria with increasing infectivity and resistance. By contrast, fluctuating selection on individual host and parasite genotypes was maintained over time, becoming increasingly important for the phenotypic properties of parasite and host populations. Given that costs of generalism are reported for many other systems, arms races may generally give way to fluctuating selection in antagonistically coevolving populations.},

If males provide little or no aid to offspring, a high (up to 2-fold) extra average fitness has to emerge as a property of a sexual parentage if sex is to be stable. The advantage must presumably come from recombination but has been hard to identify. It may well lie in the necessity to recombine defenses to defeat numerous parasites. A model demonstrating this works best for contesting hosts whose defense polymorphisms are constrained to low mutation rates. A review of the literature shows that the predictions of parasite coevolution fit well with the known ecology of sex. Moreover, parasite coevolution is superior to previous models of the evolution of sex by supporting the stability of sex under the following challenging conditions: very low fecundity, realistic patterns of genotype fitness and changing environment, and frequent mutation to parthenogenesis, even while sex pays the full 2-fold cost.},

  abstract = {Overdispersion is common in models of count data in ecology and evolutionary biology, and can occur due to missing covariates, non-independent (aggregated) data, or an excess frequency of zeroes (zero-inflation). Accounting for overdispersion in such models is vital, as failing to do so can lead to biased parameter estimates, and false conclusions regarding hypotheses of interest. Observation-level random effects (OLRE), where each data point receives a unique level of a random effect that models the extra-Poisson variation present in the data, are commonly employed to cope with overdispersion in count data. However studies investigating the efficacy of observation-level random effects as a means to deal with overdispersion are scarce. Here I use simulations to show that in cases where overdispersion is caused by random extra-Poisson noise, or aggregation in the count data, observation-level random effects yield more accurate parameter estimates compared to when overdispersion is simply ignored. Conversely, OLRE fail to reduce bias in zero-inflated data, and in some cases increase bias at high levels of overdispersion. There was a positive relationship between the magnitude of overdispersion and the degree of bias in parameter estimates. Critically, the simulations reveal that failing to account for overdispersion in mixed models can erroneously inflate measures of explained variance (r2), which may lead to researchers overestimating the predictive power of variables of interest. This work suggests use of observation-level random effects provides a simple and robust means to account for overdispersion in count data, but also that their ability to minimise bias is not uniform across all types of overdispersion and must be applied judiciously.},

This chapter provides an overview of malacosporean-bryozoan interactions by discussing effects of parasitism on host fitness and strategies of host exploitation through virulent overt and avirulent covert infections. Evidence for host-condition dependent development and substantial levels of vertical transmission in bryozoan propagules (statoblasts) and colony fragments suggests virulence strategies that are closely tied to clonal reproduction in bryozoan hosts. Although there is evidence for T. bryosalmonae strain variation and host specificity, there is much scope for examining patterns of infection in relation to host clonality and local adaptation. The development of overt infections in bryozoans in good condition suggests that environmental change (e.g. warmer temperatures, eutrophication) will entail changes in malacosporean-bryozoan interactions which may, in turn, relate to disease emergence in fish.},

We examine the direct and indirect effects of parasitism and discuss examples of density and parasiteinduced trait-mediated effects. Recent work reveals previously unrecognized complexity in parasite-mediated interactions. In addition to parasite-modified and apparent competition leading to species exclusion or enabling coexistence, parasites and predators interact in different ways to regulate or destablize the population dynamics of their joint prey. An emerging area is the impact of parasites on intraguild predation (IGP). Parasites can increase vulnerability of infected individuals to cannibalism or predation resulting in reversed species dominance in IGP hierarchies. We discuss the potential significance of parasites for community structure and biodiversity, in particular their role in promoting species exclusion or coexistence and the impact of emerging diseases. Ongoing invasions provide examples where parasites mediate native/invader interactions and play a key role in determining the outcome of invasions. We highlight the need for more quantitative data to assess the impact of parasites on communities, and the combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how the effects of parasitism scale up to community-level processes.},

We enriched plants of central patches with 15N, then measured d15N in green lynx spiders, the most abundant insect predator, in patches that were either connected to or isolated from the enriched patch. We found that corridors increased prey movement, as they increased spider d15N by 40\% in connected patches. Corridors also improved spider body condition, increasing nitrogen relative to carbon. We suggest a novel mechanism, trophic subsidies, through which corridors may increase the stability or size of populations in connected landscapes.},

  abstract = {Abiotic environmental heterogeneity can promote the evolution of diverse resource specialists, which in turn may increase the degree of host\textendash{}parasite specialization. We coevolved Pseudomonas fluorescens and lytic phage /2 in spatially structured populations, each consisting of two interconnected subpopulations evolving in the same or different nutrient media (homogeneous and heterogeneous environments, respectively). Counter to the normal expectation, host\textendash{}parasite specialization was significantly lower in heterogeneous compared with homogeneous environments. This result could not be explained by dispersal homogenizing populations, as this would have resulted in the heterogeneous treatments having levels of specialization equal to or greater than that of the homogeneous environments. We argue that selection for costly generalists is greatest when the coevolving species are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and that this can provide an explanation for our results. A simple coevolutionary model of this process suggests that this can be a general mechanism by which environmental heterogeneity can reduce rather than increase host\textendash{}parasite specialization.},

  abstract = {Should parasites stabilize or destabilize consumer\textendash{}resource dynamics? Recent theory suggests that parasite-e\-nhanced mortality may confer underappreciated stability to their hosts. We tested this hypothesis using disease in zooplankton. Across both natural and experimental epidemics, bigger epidemics correlated with larger\textemdash{}not smaller\textemdash{}host fluctuations. Thus, we tested two mechanistic hypotheses to explain destabilization or a\-pparent destabilization by parasites. First, enrichment could, in principle, simultaneously enhance both instability and disease prevalence. In natural epidemics, destabilization was correlated with enrichment (indexed by total phosphorous). However, an in situ (lake enclosure) experiment did not support these links. Instead, field and experimental results point to a novel destabilizing mechanism involving host stage structure. Epidemics pushed hosts from relatively more stable host dynamics with less-s\-ynchronized juveniles and adults to less stable dynamics with more-s\-ynchronized juveniles and adults. Our results demonstrate how links between host stage structure and disease can shape host/consumer\textendash{}resource stability.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the question of how spatial heterogeneity in prey productivity and migration act to determine geographic patterns in antagonistic coevolution with a predator. We develop and analyze a quantitative coevolutionary model for a predator-prey interaction. If the model is modified appropriately, the results could broadly apply to multispecies communities and to herbivore-plant, parasite-host, and parasitoid-host associations. Model populations are distributed over a gradient in prey birth rate (as a measure of productivity). Each population, in each patch, is made up of a suite of strains. Each strain of the predator has a certain ability to successfully attack each strain of the prey. We consider scenarios of isolated patches, global migration, and stepping-stone (i.e., local) migration over a linear string of patches. The most pervasive patterns are the following: investments in predator offense and prey defense are both maximal in the patches of highest prey productivity; when there are no constraints on maximal investment, mean predation evolves to highest levels in the most productive patches; similarly, the predator has a greater impact (measured as the percentage reduction in prey density) on the prey population in high productivity patches as compared with low productivity ones\textemdash{}in spite (even after evolution) of prey abundance being highest in the most productive patches; and migration has the net effect of shunting relatively offensive and defensive strains from productive patches to nonproductive ones, potentially resulting in the elimination of otherwise rare, low-investment clones. A modification of the model to gene-forgene type interactions predicts that generalist strains (in terms of the range of strains the predator can exploit or the prey can fend off) dominate in productive areas of the prey, whereas specialists prevail in marginal habitats. Assuming a wide range of productivities over the prey's geographical distribution, the greatest strain diversity should be found in habitats of intermediate productivity. We discuss the implications of our study for adaptation and conservation. Empirical studies are in broad accord with our findings.},

Random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) polymorphisms allow analysis of species for which previous DNA sequence information is lacking, but dominance makes it impossible to apply standard techniques to calculate F-statistics. We describe a Bayesian method that allows direct estimates of FST from dominant markers. In contrast to existing alternatives, we do not assume previous knowledge of the degree of within-population inbreeding. In particular, we do not assume that genotypes within populations are in Hardy\textendash{}Weinberg proportions. Our estimate of FST incorporates uncertainty about the magnitude of within-population inbreeding. Simulations show that samples from even a relatively small number of loci and populations produce reliable estimates of FST. Moreover, some information about the degree of within-population inbreeding (FIS) is available from data sets with a large number of loci and populations. We illustrate the method with a reanalysis of RAPD data from 14 populations of a North American orchid, Platanthera leucophaea.},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.},

However, these studies focusing on single-host systems usually neglect that increasing connectivity can increase species diversity which might reduce pathogen transmission via the `dilution effect', a hypothesis whose generality is still disputed. On the other hand, studies investigating the generality of the dilution effect were usually conducted without considering habitat structure, which is surprising as species loss is often driven by habitat fragmentation. Using a simple general model to link fragmentation to the dilution effect, we determined the effect of connectivity on disease risk and explored when the dilution effect can be detected. We showed that landscape structure can largely modify the diversity\textendash{}disease relationship. The net impact of connectivity on disease risk can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative importance of the facilitation effect (through increasing contact rates among patches) versus the dilution effect (via increasing species richness). We also demonstrated that different risk indices (i.e. infection prevalence and abundance of infected hosts) react differently to increasing connectivity and species richness. Our study may contribute to the current debate on the dilution effect, and a better understanding of the impacts of fragmentation on disease risks.},

Digenean trematodes are parasites with complex life cycles requiring birds and other vertebrates as final hosts. We tested two hypotheses for prevalence and species richness of larval trematodes in C. californica: (1) prior to the restoration, sites to be restored would have lower trematode prevalence and species richness relative to unimpacted control sites, and (2) that these differences would diminish after restoration. The sites to be restored were initially degraded for trematode species. They had a mean trematode prevalence (12\%) and species richness (4.5 species) that were lower than control sites (28\% trematode prevalence and 7 species). Despite the differences in prevalence, the proportional representation of each trematode species in the total community was similar between sites to be restored and control sites. Over the six years following restoration, trematode prevalence nearly quadrupled at restored sites (43\%) while the prevalence at control sites (26\%) remained unchanged. In addition, species richness at restored sites doubled (9 species), while species richness at the control sites (7.8 species) did not change. Immediately after restoration, the relative abundance of trematode species using fishes as second intermediate hosts declined while those using molluscs as second intermediate hosts increased. Trematode communities at restored and control sites gradually returned to being similar. We interpret the increase in trematode prevalence and species richness at restored sites to be a direct consequence of changes in bird use of the restored habitat. This study demonstrates a new comparative technique for assessing wetlands, and while it does not supplant biotic surveys, it informs such taxonomic lists. Most importantly, it provides a synthetic quantification of the linkages among species in wetland food webs.},

  abstract = {Associations between mycophagous Drosophila and nematode parasites occur throughout the temperate and boreal regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. The nematode Howardula aoronymphium has substantial adverse effects on host survival and fertility on North American Drosophila. Long-term data show that rainy summers lead to a high prevalence of parasitism in the fall and the following spring, resulting in up to a 1-yr time lag between present rainfall and increased prevalence of H. aoronymphium parasitism. A biogeographic analysis of the relative abundance of different Drosophila species has shown that H. aoronymphium may facilitate the coexistence of different species of Drosophila that compete for larval food resources. The actual host range of parasites in nature is determined by the intrinsic suitability of potential hosts for parasite infection and reproduction and various ecological factors. For H. aoronymphium in eastern North America, intrinsically suitable hosts fall within a restricted clade within the genus Drosophila. However, the temperature sensitivity of H. aoronymphium prevents it from using several host species that occur outside the geographical range of the nematodes. Finally, the host range, virulence, and geographical range of Drosophila-parasitic nematodes appear to be highly dynamic over evolutionary timescales.},

  abstract = {Sexual populations should be vulnerable to invasion and replacement by ecologically similar asexual females because asexual lineages have higher per capita growth rates. However, as asexual genotypes become common, they may also become disproportionately infected by parasites. The Red Queen hypothesis postulates that high infection rates in the common asexual clones could periodically favor the genetically diverse sexual individuals and promote the short-term coexistence of sexual and asexual populations. Testing this idea requires comparison of competing sexual and asexual lineages that are attacked by natural parasites. To date no such data have been available. Here, we report on long-term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a ``mixed'' (sexual and asexual) population of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). We found that, within 7\textendash{}10 years, the most common clones were almost completely replaced by initially rare clones in two different habitats, while sexuals persisted throughout the study period. The common clones, which were initially more resistant to infection, also became more susceptible to infection by sympatric (but not allopatric) parasites over the course of the study. These results are consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis and show that the coevolutionary dynamics predicted by the theory may also favor sexual reproduction in natural populations.},

To explore the genetic basis behind host\textendash{}parasite coevolution we chose two parasitic fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, representing the most important entomopathogenic fungi used in the biological control of pest or vector insects) and two established insect model hosts (the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella and the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum) for which sequenced genomes or comprehensive transcriptomes are available. Focusing on these model organisms, we review the knowledge about the interactions between fungal molecules operating as virulence factors and insect host-derived defense molecules mediating antifungal immunity. Particularly the study of the intimate interactions between fungal proteinases and corresponding host-derived proteinase inhibitors elucidated novel coevolutionary mechanisms such as functional shifts or diversification of involved effector molecules. Complementarily, we compared the outcome of coevolution experiments using the parasitic fungus B. bassiana and two different insect hosts which were initially either susceptible (Galleria mellonella) or resistant (Tribolium castaneum). Taking a snapshot of host\textendash{}parasite coevolution, we show that parasitic fungi can overcome host barriers such as external antimicrobial secretions just as hosts can build new barriers, both within a relatively short time of coevolution.},

However, GST necessarily approaches zero when gene diversity is high, even if subpopulations are completely differentiated, and it is not monotonic with increasing differentiation. Likewise, when diversity is equated with heterozygosity, standard similarity measures formed by taking the ratio of mean within-subpopulation diversity to total diversity necessarily approach unity when diversity is high, even if the subpopulations are completely dissimilar (no shared alleles). None of these measures can be interpreted as measures of differentiation or similarity. The derivations of these measures contain two subtle misconceptions which cause their paradoxical behaviours. Conclusions about population differentiation, gene flow, relatedness, and conservation priority will often be wrong when based on these fixation indices or similarity measures. These are not statistical issues; the problems persist even when true population frequencies are used in the calculations. Recent advances in the mathematics of diversity identify the misconceptions, and yield mathematically consistent descriptive measures of population structure which eliminate the paradoxes produced by standard measures. These measures can be directly related to the migration and mutation rates of the finite-island model.},

Parasite populations should be locally adapted, having higher mean fitness on sympatric than allopatric hosts. Here we assess evidence for local parasite advantage. Further we investigate how adaptation and counter-adaptation of parasites and hosts, necessarily occurring in sympatry, can generate a pattern of local adaptation. Already simple frequency-dependent selection models generate complex patterns of parasite performance on sympatric and allopatric populations. In metapopulations, with extinction, recolonization, and gene flow, variable selection pressure and stochasticity may obscure local processes or change the level at which local adaptation occurs. Alternatively, gene flow may introduce adaptive variation, so differential migration rates can modify the asymmetry of host and parasite evolutionary rates. We conclude that local adaptation is an average phenomenon. Its detection requires adequate replication at the appropriate level, that at which the local processes occur.},

Within populations, fungal strains had similar means, but varied in performance across plant populations. Variation in resistance among seed families indicates the potential for parasite-mediated selection, whereas there was little evidence for local pathogen genotype {$\cdot$} plant genotype interactions assumed by most theoretical coevolution models. Lower spore production on sympatric than allopatric hosts confirmed local fungal maladaptation already observed for infectivity. Correlations between infectivity and latency or spore production suggest a common mechanism for variation in these traits. Our results suggest low variation available to this pathogen for tracking its coevolving host.

Parasites represent important selective agents and have received renewed attention in speciation research. We review the literature on parasite-mediated divergent selection in context of ecological speciation and present empirical evidence for three nonexclusive mechanisms by which parasites might facilitate speciation: reduced viability or fecundity of immigrants and hybrids, assortative mating as a pleiotropic by-product of host adaptation, and ecologically-based sexual selection. We emphasise the lack of research on speciation continuums, which is why no study has yet made a convincing case for parasite driven divergent evolution to initiate the emergence of reproductive isolation. We also point interest towards selection imposed by single versus multiple parasite species, conceptually linking this to strength and multifariousness of selection. Moreover, we discuss how parasites, by manipulating behaviour or impairing sensory abilities of hosts, may change the form of selection that underlies speciation. We conclude that future studies should consider host populations at variable stages of the speciation process, and explore recurrent patterns of parasitism and resistance that could pinpoint the role of parasites in imposing the divergent selection that initiates ecological speciation.},

  abstract = {The transmission of infectious diseases is an inherently ecological process involving interactions among at least two, and often many, species. Not surprisingly, then, the species diversity of ecological communities can potentially affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. Although a number of studies have now identified effects of diversity on disease prevalence, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear in many cases. Starting with simple epidemiological models, we describe a suite of mechanisms through which diversity could increase or decrease disease risk, and illustrate the potential applicability of these mechanisms for both vector-borne and non-vector-borne diseases, and for both specialist and generalist pathogens. We review examples of how these mechanisms may operate in specific disease systems. Because the effects of diversity on multi-host disease systems have been the subject of much recent research and controversy, we describe several recent efforts to delineate under what general conditions host diversity should increase or decrease disease prevalence, and illustrate these with examples. Both models and literature reviews suggest that high host diversity is more likely to decrease than increase disease risk. Reduced disease risk with increasing host diversity is especially likely when pathogen transmission is frequency-dependent, and when pathogen transmission is greater within species than between species, particularly when the most competent hosts are also relatively abundant and widespread. We conclude by identifying focal areas for future research, including (1) describing patterns of change in disease risk with changing diversity; (2) identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed changes in risk; (3) clarifying additional mechanisms in a wider range of epidemiological models; and (4) experimentally manipulating disease systems to assess the impact of proposed mechanisms.},

  abstract = {In order to conduct experiments on interactions between animals and food organisms, it is necessary to develop a medium that adequately supports the growth of both algae and zooplankton without the need to alter the medium to accommodate either the algae or the animals. We devised a freshwater medium, named COMBO, that supports excellent growth of both algae and zooplankton. Two types of algae, Ankistrodesmus falcatus and Stephanodiscus hantzschii, were reared in COMBO and their growth rates were not significantly different from those of algae grown in a reference medium (WC). One of these algae, A. falcatus, was then fed to a cladoceran, Daphnia pulicaria, which was also cultured in COMBO, and the resulting fecundities of D. pulicaria were compared to those of animals reared in natural surface water. We also determined whether the value of COMBO as a medium for D. pulicaria was affected by modifications in nitrogen or phosphorus concentration to evaluate whether the new medium will be useful in nutritional research. Lowering the N or P content of COMBO did not affect the reproductive performance of D. pulicaria. Other researchers have also reported excellent growth and reproduction by numerous algae and zooplankton reared in COMBO. Our results suggest that COMBO is an effective artificial, defined culture medium capable of supporting robust growth and reproduction of both freshwater algae and zooplankton.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of sexual reproduction in natural populations is a pressing question for evolutionary biologists [1, 2]. Under the ``Red Queen'' hypothesis, coevolving parasites reduce the reproductive advantage of asexual reproduction by adapting to infect clonal genotypes after they become locally common [3\textendash{}6]. In addition, the ``geographic mosaic'' theory of coevolution proposes that structured populations of interacting species can produce selection mosaics manifested as coevolutionary ``hot spots'' and ``cold spots'' [7]. Here, we tested whether a steep, habitatspecific cline in the frequency of sexual reproduction in a freshwater snail could be explained by the existence of hot spots and cold spots for coevolving parasites. We found that the shallow-water margins of lakes, where sexual reproduction is most common, are coevolutionary hot spots, and that deeper habitats are cold spots. These results are consistent with the geographic mosaic theory, in that the intensity of selection resulting from biological interactions can vary sharply in space. The results also support the Red Queen hypothesis, in that sex is associated with coevolutionary hot spots for virulent parasites.},

Model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely.

Predicting how phages might influence community stability and apparent competition, however, requires an understanding of how bacteria-phage interaction networks evolve as a function of host diversity and community dynamics. Here, we first review the progress that has been made in understanding phage specificity, including the use of experimental evolution, we then introduce a new dataset on natural bacteriophages collected from the phyllosphere of horse chestnut trees, and finally we highlight that bacterial sensitivity to phage is rarely a binary trait and that this variation should be taken into account and reported. We emphasize that there is currently insufficient evidence to make broad generalizations about phage host range in natural populations, the limits of phage adaptation to novel hosts, or the implications of phage specificity in shaping microbial communities. However, the combination of experimental and genomic approaches with the study of natural communities will allow new insight to the evolution and impact of phage specificity within complex bacterial communities.},

  abstract = {Background: The Red Queen Hypothesis (RQH) suggests that the coevolutionary dynamics of host-parasite systems can generate selection for increased host recombination. Since host-parasite interactions often have a strong genetic basis, recombination between different hosts can increase the fraction of novel and potentially resistant offspring genotypes. A prerequisite for this mechanism is that host-parasite interactions generate persistent oscillations of linkage disequilibria (LD).
Results: We use deterministic and stochastic models to investigate the persistence of LD oscillations and its impact on the RQH. The standard models of the Red Queen dynamics exhibit persistent LD oscillations under most circumstances. Here, we show that altering the standard model from discrete to continuous time or from simultaneous to sequential updating results in damped LD oscillations. This suggests that LD oscillations are structurally not robust. We then show that in a stochastic regime, drift can counteract this dampening and maintain the oscillations. In addition, we show that the amplitude of the oscillations and therefore the strength of the resulting selection for or against recombination are inversely proportional to the size of the (host) population.
Conclusion: We find that host parasite-interactions cannot generally maintain oscillations in the absence of drift. As a consequence, the RQH can strongly depend on population size and should therefore not be interpreted as a purely deterministic hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding the forces that maintain diversity across a range of scales is at the very heart of biology. Frequency-dependent processes are generally recognized as the most central process for the maintenance of ecological diversity. The same is, however, not generally true for genetic diversity. Negative frequency dependent selection, where rare genotypes have an advantage, is often regarded as a relatively weak force in maintaining genetic variation in life history traits because recombination disassociates alleles across many genes. Yet, many regions of the genome show low rates of recombination and genetic variation in such regions (i.e., supergenes) may in theory be upheld by frequency dependent selection.
Results: We studied what is essentially a ubiquitous life history supergene (i.e., mitochondrial DNA) in the fruit fly Drosophila subobscura, showing sympatric polymorphism with two main mtDNA genotypes co-occurring in populations world-wide. Using an experimental evolution approach involving manipulations of genotype starting frequencies, we show that negative frequency dependent selection indeed acts to maintain genetic variation in this region. Moreover, the strength of selection was affected by food resource conditions.
Conclusions: Our work provides novel experimental support for the view that balancing selection through negative frequency dependency acts to maintain genetic variation in life history genes. We suggest that the emergence of negative frequency dependent selection on mtDNA is symptomatic of the fundamental link between ecological processes related to resource use and the maintenance of genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Tolerance, the ability of a host to limit the negative fitness effects of a given parasite load, is now recognised as an important host defence strategy in animals. Together with resistance, the ability of a host to limit parasite load, these two host strategies represent two disparate host responses to parasites, each with different predicted evolutionary consequences: resistance is predicted to reduce parasite prevalence, whereas tolerance could be neutral towards, or increase, parasite prevalence in a population. The distinction between these two strategies might have far-reaching epidemiological consequences. Classically, a reaction norm defines host tolerance because it depicts the change in host fitness as a function of parasite load, where a shallow negative slope indicates that host fitness slowly deteriorates as parasite load increases (i.e., high tolerance). Despite the fact that tolerance was only recently acknowledged to be an important component in an animal's immune repertoire, it is frequently referenced, so our aim is to emphasise the current advances on the topic. We begin by summarising the ways in which biologists measure the two components of tolerance, parasite load and fitness, as well as the ways in which the concept has been defined (i.e., point and range tolerance). It is common to test for variation in host tolerance according to intrinsic, innate factors, where variation exists among populations, genders or genotypes. Such variation in tolerance is pervasive across animal taxa, and we briefly review some of the mechanistic bases of variation that have recently begun to be explored. Three further novel advancements in the tolerance field are the appreciation of the role of extrinsic, environmental factors on tolerance, host tolerance in multi-host\textendash{}parasite systems and individual-based approaches to tolerance measures. We explore these topics using recent examples and suggest some future perspectives. It is becoming increasingly clear that an appreciation of tolerance as a defence strategy can provide significant insights into how hosts coexist with parasites.},

We propose, however, that host obligate asexuality can be favoured in the long term, despite the effects of parasites, under the following conditions. First, the host population structure should approximate a metapopulation. Second, the hosts or the parasites should exhibit relatively high levels of dispersal. Third, parasites must disperse independently of their hosts. In support of this view, we present a computer simulation of host\textemdash{}parasite coevolution in a metapopulation. The simulation demonstrates that a large difference between host and parasite dispersal rates favours an obligately asexual host reproductive strategy over an obligately sexual one. This hypothesis may explain the persistence of anciently asexual taxa, such as the bdelloid rotifers, and the patterns of dispersal seen in obligately asexual groups in general.},

  abstract = {Parasitism is the most common consumer strategy among organisms, yet only recently has there been a call for the inclusion of infectious disease agents in food webs. The value of this effort hinges on whether parasites affect food-web properties. Increasing evidence suggests that parasites have the potential to uniquely alter food-web topology in terms of chain length, connectance and robustness. In addition, parasites might affect food-web stability, interaction strength and energy flow. Food-web structure also affects infectious disease dynamics because parasites depend on the ecological networks in which they live. Empirically, incorporating parasites into food webs is straightforward. We may start with existing food webs and add parasites as nodes, or we may try to build food webs around systems for which we already have a good understanding of infectious processes. In the future, perhaps researchers will add parasites while they construct food webs. Less clear is how food-web theory can accommodate parasites. This is a deep and central problem in theoretical biology and applied mathematics. For instance, is representing parasites with complex life cycles as a single node equivalent to representing other species with ontogenetic niche shifts as a single node? Can parasitism fit into fundamental frameworks such as the niche model? Can we integrate infectious disease models into the emerging field of dynamic food-web modelling? Future progress will benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations between ecologists and infectious disease biologists.},

The subject is increasingly attracting the attention of health professionals and climate-change scientists, particularly with respect to malaria and other vector-transmitted human diseases. The result has been the emergence of a crisis discipline, reminiscent of the early phases of conservation biology. Latitudinal, altitudinal, seasonal, and interannual associations between climate and disease along with historical and experimental evidence suggest that climate, along with many other factors, can affect infectious diseases in a nonlinear fashion. However, although the globe is significantly warmer than it was a century ago, there is little evidence that climate change has already favored infectious diseases. While initial projections suggested dramatic future increases in the geographic range of infectious diseases, recent models predict range shifts in disease distributions, with little net increase in area. Many factors can affect infectious disease, and some may overshadow the effects of climate.},

The parasite, which is superficially similar to Glugoides intestinalis (Chatton, 1907), invades the gut epithelium of Daphnia magna, where the complete development takes place in a host cell-derived parasitophorous vacuole. Merogonial and sporogonial stages occur together in the vacuole, with presporal stages at the periphery, mature spores aggregated in the centre. All life cycle stages have isolated nuclei. Merogonial plasmodia are initially rounded, later elongated, and they give rise to four merozoites. The bouts of merogony are unknown. The sporont produces two sporoblast mother cells, which often remain coupled. Each cell generates a chain of four sporoblasts. Sporophorous vesicles are not produced. Mature spores are pyriform with a pointed anterior pole and with an obliquely positioned posterior vacuole. Unfixed spores measure 1.33-2.29 x 2.32-3.69 urn, The exospore is uniform, about 11 nm thick. The polar filament is isofilar, 82-85 nm wide, making 5-6 coils in the posterior half of the spore. The polaroplast is uniform, composed of about 28 nm, wide lamellar components, where the lamellae are folded around each other. The discrimination from other microsporidian species and the systematic position are briefly discussed. A new family, Ordosporidae, is established and Endoreticulatus durforti Martinez et al., 1993 is transferred to Ordospora.},

  abstract = {Evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle adaptations that often surprise the scientists who discover them. However, the creativity of evolution is not limited to the natural world: artificial organisms evolving in computational environments have also elicited surprise and wonder from the researchers studying them. The process of evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution can provide examples of how their evolving algorithms and organisms have creatively subverted their expectations or intentions, exposed unrecognized bugs in their code, produced unexpectedly adaptations, or engaged in behaviors and outcomes uncannily convergent with ones found in nature. Such stories routinely reveal surprise and creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. Bugs are fixed, experiments are refocused, and one-off surprises are collapsed into a single data point. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

  abstract = {Individuals invest limited resources across vital tasks such as reproduction and survival. Individuals can spread reproductive investment over their lifetime, but cues of death or reduced fitness can influence this investment. In some systems, cues of infection induce early but costly reproduction through fecundity compensation as future reproduction becomes uncertain. A key aspect of parasite biology is the delay between exposure to parasites and the onset of virulence. This creates an important window of opportunity for hosts to respond to infection. Existing models have not accounted for this delay or the costs borne by offspring. We combine a theoretical and experimental approach to assess the role of costs and the importance of delay in virulence on fecundity compensation. We find that a delay in virulence selects for plastic fecundity responses even with moderate offspring costs. We tested our model experimentally by exposing pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, to various ecologically relevant cues of infection and monitored lifetime reproduction and survival of these aphids and their offspring. Our challenges induced fecundity compensation, but we did not detect any costs in mothers or offspring. We predict that the relationship between the costs and the delay in onset of virulence, as found here, determines the success of fecundity compensation as an adaptation against parasitism.},

We tested for frequency-dependent selection on contrasting behavioural strategies, termed here `personalities', in three species of social spiders, each thought to represent an independent evolutionary origin of sociality. The evolution of sociality in the spider genus Anelosimus is consistently met with the emergence of two temporally stable discrete personality types: an `aggressive' or `docile' form. We assessed how the foraging success of each phenotype changes as a function of its representation within a colony. We did this by creating experimental colonies of various compositions (six aggressives, three aggressives and three dociles, one aggressive and five dociles, six dociles), maintaining them in a common garden for 3 weeks, and tracking the mass gained by individuals of either phenotype. We found that both the docile and aggressive phenotypes experienced their greatest mass gain in mixed colonies of mostly docile individuals. However, the performance of both phenotypes decreased as the frequency of the aggressive phenotype increased. Nearly identical patterns of phenotype-specific frequency dependence were recovered in all three species. Naturally occurring colonies of these spiders exhibit mixtures dominated by the docile phenotype, suggesting that these spiders may have evolved mechanisms to maintain the compositions that maximize the success of the colony without compromising the expected reproductive output of either phenotype.},

  abstract = {There has been a renewed controversy on the processes that determine evolution in spatially structured populations. Recent theoretical and empirical studies have suggested that parasites should be expected to be more {\^O}{\^O}prudent{\~O}{\~O} (less harmful and slower transmitting) when infection occurs locally. Using a novel approach based on spatial moment equations, we show that the evolution of parasites in spatially structured host populations is determined by the interplay of genetic and demographic spatial structuring, which in turn depends on the details of the ecological dynamics. This allows a detailed understanding of the roles of epidemiology, demography and network topology. Demographic turnover is needed for local interactions to select for prudence in the susceptible-infected models that have been the focus of previous studies. In diseases with little demographic turnover (as typical of many human diseases), we show that only parasites causing diseases with long-lived immunity are likely to be prudent in space. We further demonstrate why, at intermediate parasite dispersal, virulence can evolve to higher levels than predicted by non-spatial theory.},

A large variety of theoretical models have attempted to understand how local dispersal may shape the coevolution of interacting species such as host\textendash{}parasite interactions. The lack of a unifying framework is a serious impediment for anyone willing to understand current theory. Here, we review previous theoretical studies in the light of a single epidemiological model that allows us to explore the effects of both host and parasite migration rates on the evolution and coevolution of various life-history traits. We discuss the impact of local dispersal on parasite virulence, various host defence strategies and local adaptation. Our analysis shows that evolutionary and coevolutionary outcomes crucially depend on the details of the host\textendash{}parasite life cycle and on which life-history trait is involved in the interaction. We also discuss experimental studies that support the effects of spatial structure on the evolution of host\textendash{}parasite interactions. This review highlights major similarities between some theoretical results, but it also reveals an important gap between evolutionary and coevolutionary models. We discuss possible ways to bridge this gap within a more unified framework that would reconcile spatial epidemiology, evolution and coevolution.},

The present study examined temporal variation in resistance of hosts and infectivity of parasites within three populations of Daphnia magna infected with the sterilizing bacterium Pasteuria ramosa. Parasite isolates and host clones were collected in each of two years (1997, 1998) from one population; in two other populations, hosts were collected from both years, but parasites from only the first year. We then performed infection experiments (separately for each population) that exposed hosts to parasites from the same year or made combinations involving hosts and parasites from different years. In two populations, patterns were consistent with the evolution of host resistance: either infectivity or the speed with which parasites sterilized hosts declined from 1997 to 1998. In another population, infectivity, virulence, and parasite spore production did not vary among host-year or parasite-year. For this population, we also detected strong within-population genetic variation for resistance. Thus, in this case, genetic variability for fitness-related traits apparently did not translate into evolutionary change. We discuss a number of reasons why genetic change may not occur as expected in parasite-host systems, including negative correlations between resistance and other traits, gene flow, or that the dynamic process itself may obscure the detection of gene frequency changes.},

The results were inconsistent with the prediction of the reproductive assurance hypothesis; male frequency was not significantly or positively correlated with snail density. Thus, there was no support for any of the hypotheses for the maintenance of sex that rely on selection for reproductive assurance to explain the distribution of parthenogenesis (e.g., recombinational repair). The results, however, were consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis; male frequency was positively and significantly correlated with the frequency of individuals infected by trematodes. This correlation suggests that parthenogenetic females have replaced sexual females in populations where parasites are rare, and that sexual females have persisted in populations where parasites are common.},

In the present study, we consider the effects that parasites have on parthenogenetic mutants in obligately sexual, dioecious populations. Computer simulations show that repeated mutation to parthenogenesis can lead to the accumulation of clones with different resistance genotypes, and that a moderately diverse set of clones could competitively exclude the ancestral sexual subpopulation. The simulations also show that, when there are reasonable rates of deleterious mutation, Muller's ratchet combined with coevolutionary interactions with parasites can lead to the evolutionary stability of cross-fertilization. In addition, we consider the effects that parasites can have on the evolution of uniparental reproduction in cosexual populations. Strategy models show that parasites and inbreeding depression could interact to select for evolutionarily stable reproductive strategies that involve mixtures of selfed and outcrossed progeny.},

Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10\% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host-parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect.},

As such, parasites would be expected to be better at infecting sympatric host populations than allopatric host populations. Here we examined all published and unpublished infection experiments on a snailtrematode system (Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Microphallus sp., respectively). A meta-analysis demonstrated significant local adaptation by the parasite, and a variance components analysis showed that the variance due to the host-parasite interaction far exceeded the variance due to the main effects of host source and parasite source. The meta-analysis also indicated that asexual host populations were more resistant to allopatric sources of parasites than were (mostly) sexual host populations, but we found no significant differences among parasite populations in the strength of local adaptation. This result suggests that triploid asexual snails are more resistant to remote sources of parasites, but the parasite has, through coevolution, overcome the difference. Finally, we found that the degree of local adaptation did not depend on the genetic distance among host populations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the parasites are adapted, on average, to infecting their local host populations and suggest that they may be a factor in selecting against common host genotypes in natural populations.},

One promising explanation is that parasites could counter the reproductive advantages of asexual reproduction by exerting frequencydependent selection against common clones (the Red Queen hypothesis). One apparent limitation of the Red Queen theory, however, is that parasites would seem to be required by theory to be highly virulent. In the present study, I present a population-dynamic view of competition between sexual females and asexual females that interact with co-evolving parasites. The results show that asexual populations have higher carrying capacities, and more unstable population dynamics, than sexual populations. The results also suggest that the spread of a clone into a sexual population could increase the effective parasite virulence as population density increases. This combination of parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection, and density-dependent virulence, could lead to the coexistence of sexual and asexual reproductive strategies and the long-term persistence of sex.},

The focus is on the fate of obligately sexual populations facing competition with one or more obligately asexual clones. An early simulation model by Hamilton (Hamilton WD. 1980. Sex versus non-sex versus parasite. Oikos. 35:282\textendash{}290.) suggested that parasites could be an important force in selecting against asexual clones, leading to the persistence of sex. This result was consistent with a number of independent verbal models generated from 1975\textendash{}1983. Conversely, the models by May and Anderson (May RM, Anderson RM. 1983. Epidemiology and genetics in the coevolution of parasites and hosts. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 219:281\textendash{}313.), which included more epidemiological detail, suggested that parasites were an unlikely source of selection to favor sexual over asexual reproduction. Thus began an oscillation of opinion regarding the role of parasites in selection for sex. It would seem at present that some of the differences of opinion over time stemmed from the different ways that models were constructed, including whether the sexual population was in competition with a genetically diverse asexual population or a single clonal genotype. On theoretical grounds, parasite-mediated selection for sex seems more likely if the sexual population has options in genotypic space that are not available to the clones. Models that incorporate more ecological realism also seem more favorable to the parasite theory of sex.},

Computer simulations further showed that evolution in the parasite population tends to increase the covariance, which can lead to epidemiological feedbacks. However, the covariances can also become negative during counteradaptation by the host, leading to oscillatory dynamics in host and parasite fitness. Nonetheless, when parasite-mediated selection is strong, the covariance is positive on average, which facilitates the spread of disease. Positive covariances may also underlie patterns of local adaptation in parasite populations and increase the selective advantage of cross-fertilization in host populations.},

More recently, reciprocal cross-inoculation experiments have been used to evaluate adaptation by parasites to their local host populations.These experiments are conceptually similar to reciprocal-transplant experiments, except that the ``environment'' (the host population) may have evolved in response to changes in the parasite population. Here, I use analytical tools and computer simulations to determine when parasites would be expected to be more infective to their local host populations than to allopatric host populations. The models assume that parasites have to genetically ``match'' their hosts in order to infect. I also assumed that different host clones were favored in different populations. When parasite virulence was low, clonal selection outweighed parasite-mediated selection, leading to low host diversity within populations and strong LA by parasites. At intermediate levels of virulence, parasite-mediated selection maintained high levels of host diversity within populations, which reduced or eliminated parasite LA. The loss of parasite LA was not associated with increased infectivity by parasites on allopatric hosts. Instead, the loss of LA was due to a reduction in infectivity of parasites on sympatric hosts. Finally, at high levels of parasite virulence, parasite-mediated selection led to oscillatory host dynamics and weak local adaption by parasites. Across all levels of virulence, the strength of parasite LA closely tracked the degree of host population structure (GST).},

However, the behaviour of MP with marine phytoplanktonic cells remains little studied and thus unpredictable. The present study assessed the potential for phytoplankton cells to form hetero-aggregates with small micro-polystyrene (micro-PS) particles depending on microalgal species and physiological status. A prymnesiophycea, Tisochrysis lutea, a dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa triquetra, and a diatom, Chaetoceros neogracile, were exposed to micro-PS (2 mm diameter; 3.96 mg L{\`A}1) during their growth culture cycles. Micro-PS were quantified using an innovative flow-cytometry approach, which allowed the monitoring of the micro-PS repartition in microalgal cultures and the distinction between free suspended micro-PS and hetero-aggregates of micro-PS and microalgae. Hetero-aggregation was observed for C. neogracile during the stationary growth phase. The highest levels of micro-PS were ``lost'' from solution, sticking to flasks, with T. lutea and H. triquetra cultures. This loss of micro-PS sticking to the flask walls increased with the age of the culture for both species. No effects of micro-PS were observed on microalgal physiology in terms of growth and chlorophyll fluorescence. Overall, these results highlight the potential for single phytoplankton cells and residual organic matter to interact with microplastics, and thus potentially influence their distribution and bioavailability in experimental systems and the water column.},

In this study, we compared the genetic structure and diversity of adult Neolebouria georgenascimentoi in two fish species (DHs) that are extensively distributed along the south-eastern Pacific (SEP). The analysis was based on the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene sequences of parasites collected between 23\textdegree{}S and 45\textdegree{}S. In total, 202 sequences of N. georgenascimentoi in Pinguipes chilensis isolated from nine sites and 136 sequences of Prolatilus jugularis from five sites were analysed. Our results showed that N. georgenascimentoi is a species complex that includes three different parasite species; however, in this study, only lineage 1 and 2 found in P. chilensis and P. jugularis, respectively, were studied because they are widely distributed along the coastline. Lineage 1 parasites had two common haplotypes with wide distribution and unique haplotypes in northern sites. Lineage 2 had only one common haplotype with wide distribution and a large number of unique haplotypes with greater genetic diversity. Both lineages have experienced recent population expansion. Only lineage 1 exhibited a genetic structure that was mainly associated with a biogeographical break at approximately 30\textdegree{}S along the SEP. Our finding suggests that host access to different prey (=intermediate hosts) could affect the genetic structure of the parasite complex discovered here. Consequently, difference between these patterns suggests that factors other than DH dispersal are involved in the genetic structure of autogenic parasites.},

  abstract = {Due to their particular way of life, dispersal of parasites is often mediated by their host's biology. Dispersal distance is relevant for parasites because high degree of dispersal leads to high gene flow, which counters the rate of parasite local adaptation in the host populations. Parasites with complex life cycles need to exploit sequentially more than one host species to complete their life cycle. Most trematode parasites have such complex life cycles involving invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. The spatial scales of invertebrate and vertebrate host populations are often different, which may decrease the probability that the parasite cycles locally in the intermediate host population. We used neutral microsatellite markers to determine genetic structure in Diplostomum pseudospathaceum parasites collected from local populations of freshwater snails (Lymnaea stagnalis). D. pseudospathaceum is a trematode that has two intermediate hosts (snail and fish) and a highly motile definitive host (bird). We found that the parasite population infecting the local snail populations showed no genetic structure over a large geographic range (over 300 km). We also did not detect evidence for isolation by distance in the parasite. We conclude that dispersal in the motile definitive host is likely to prevent emergence of local population genetic structure in the parasite. Our results suggest that parasite dispersal in the definitive host may limit local cycling of the parasites in the intermediate host populations.},

The underlying structure is a graph: individuals occupy vertices, which are connected by edges. If an individual is suited for their vertex, they receive an increase in fecundity. This framework allows attention to be restricted to the spatial arrangement of suitable habitat. We prove some basic properties of this model and find some counter-intuitive results. Notably, (1) the arrangement of suitable sites is as important as their proportion, and (2) decreasing the proportion of suitable sites may result in a decrease in the fixation time of an allele.},

Amplification of virus in any given year requires an influx of nulliparous Cs. melanura in the presence of susceptible avian hosts. We conducted laboratory experiments at constant temperatures from 10 to 34\textdegree{}C to develop thermal heat summation models to predict emergence in nature. Embryonic development progresses slowly at 10\textdegree{}C, and the time to eclosion decreased significantly as temperatures increased to 28\textdegree{}C. High temperatures were lethal and eggs failed to hatch at 32\textdegree{}C. The thermal minimum (t0) for embryonic development was 9.38\textdegree{}C, and 38.46 degrees-days (DD) were required for egg hatch. The time for larval development decreased with increasing temperatures. Cs. melanura larvae develop in subterranean habitats (crypts) where water temperatures remain below 20\textdegree{}C throughout the summer. Under controlled conditions, egg hatch to emergence took 8 mo at 10\textdegree{}C, 3 mo at 16\textdegree{}C, and 1 mo at 22\textdegree{}C. The thermal minimum for larval development (tQ) was 8.5\textdegree{}C, and 467.29 DD were required from eclosion to adult emergence. Our findings indicate that Cs. melanura is well suited to develop in cold water crypts where the larvae are collected most frequently. The mosquito appears to be bivoltine in the northeast with an overwintering generation of larvae that emerges as a spring brood of adults and a summer generation of larvae that emerges in fall. Higher than normal water temperatures hasten development of the summer generation and increase the probability for amplification of EEE by bringing large numbers of nulliparous mosquitoes into contact with recrudescing virus for subsequent transfer to the growing population of susceptible juveniles. Water temperatures in the crypts also may regulate the northern limit for virus amplification each year.},

            The consequences of parasite infection for individual hosts depend on key features of host\textendash{}parasite ecology underpinning parasite growth and immune defense, such as age, sex, resource supply, and environmental stressors. Scaling these features and their underlying mechanisms from the individual host is challenging but necessary, as they shape parasite transmission at the population level. Translating individual-level mechanisms across scales could inherently improve the way we think about feedbacks among parasitism, the mechanisms driving transmission, and the consequences of human impact and disease control efforts. Here, we use individual-based models (IBMs) based on general metabolic theory, Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory, to scale explicit life-history features of individual hosts, such as growth, reproduction, parasite production, and death, to parasite transmission at the population level over a range of resource supplies focusing on the major human parasite, Schistosoma mansoni, and its intermediate host snail, Biomphalaria glabrata. At the individual level, infected hosts produce fewer parasites at lower resources as competition increases. At the population level, our DEB\textendash{}IBM predicts brief, but intense parasite peaks early during the host growth season when resources are abundant and infected hosts are few. The timing of these peaks challenges the status quo that high densities of infected hosts produce the highest parasite densities. As expected, high resource supply boosts parasite output, but parasite output also peaks at modest to high host background mortality rates, which parallels overcompensation in stage-structured models. Our combined results reveal the crucial role of individual-level physiology in identifying how environmental conditions, time of the year, and key feedbacks within host\textendash{}parasite ecology interact to define periods of elevated risk. The testable forecasts from this physiologically-explicit epidemiological model can inform disease management to reduce human risk of schistosome infection.},

Yet, to date, the underlying genetic mechanisms and associated trait functions that are unique to rapid coevolutionary change are generally unknown. We here combined experimental evolution of the bacterial biocontrol agent Bacillus thuringiensis and its nematode host Caenorhabditis elegans with large-scale phenotyping, whole genome analysis, and functional genetics to demonstrate the selective benefit of pathogen virulence and the underlying toxin genes during the adaptation process. We show that: (i) high virulence was specifically favoured during pathogen\textendash{}host coevolution rather than pathogen one-sided adaptation to a nonchanging host or to an environment without host; (ii) the pathogen genotype BT-679 with known nematocidal toxin genes and high virulence specifically swept to fixation in all of the independent replicate populations under coevolution but only some under one-sided adaptation; (iii) high virulence in the BT-679-dominated populations correlated with elevated copy numbers of the plasmid containing the nematocidal toxin genes; (iv) loss of virulence in a toxin-plasmid lacking BT-679 isolate was reconstituted by genetic reintroduction or external addition of the toxins. We conclude that sustained coevolution is distinct from unidirectional selection in shaping the pathogen's genome and life history characteristics. To our knowledge, this study is the first to characterize the pathogen genes involved in coevolutionary adaptation in an animal host\textendash{}pathogen interaction system.},

The genetic structure of parasites is expected to conform to that of their hosts, because host dispersal is generally assumed to drive parasite dispersal. Here, we used a meta-analysis to test this paradigm and determine whether traits related to host dispersal correctly predict the spatial co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation. We compiled data from empirical work on local adaptation and host\textendash{}parasite population genetic structure from a wide range of taxonomic groups. We found that genetic differentiation was significantly lower in parasites than in hosts, suggesting that dispersal may often be higher for parasites. A significant correlation in the pairwise genetic differentiation of hosts and parasites was evident, but surprisingly weak. These results were largely explained by parasite reproductive mode, the proportion of free-living stages in the parasite life cycle and the geographical extent of the study; variables related to host dispersal were poor predictors of genetic patterns. Our results do not dispel the paradigm that parasite population genetic structure depends on host dispersal. Rather, we highlight that alternative factors are also important in driving the co-distribution of host and parasite genetic variation.},

However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing \textendash{} and exclusion \textendash{} of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known \textendash{} and not known \textendash{} about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed \textendash{} and these must employ better inferential methods \textendash{}before general conclusions can be drawn.

We will also draw attention to the relevance of routes of priming and infection, which can occur septically and orally, with largely differing physiology. For oral priming, an involvement of gut microbiota was demonstrated in mosquitoes and flour beetles. Generally, a primed state could result from long-lasting immune activation or a form of memory that does not entail lingering immune components. Moreover, the primed state could also be of a qualitatively different kind than the challenge response. Finally, we will consider that there should be natural variation in priming capability, and therefore a possibility to study this trait with experimental evolution approaches.},

  abstract = {Parasite-mediated selection is potentially of great importance in modulating genetic diversity. Genetic variation for resistance, the fuel for natural selection, appears to be common in host-parasite interactions, but responses to selection are rarely observed. In the present study, we tested whether environmental variation could mediate infection and determine evolutionary outcomes. Temperature was shown to dramatically alter the potential for parasite-mediated selection in two independent laboratory infection experiments at four temperatures. The bacterial parasite, Pasteuria ramosa, was extremely virulent at 20\cyrchar\CYRNJE{}C and 25\cyrchar\CYRNJE{}C, sterilizing its host, Daphnia magna, so that females often never produced a single brood. However, at 10\cyrchar\CYRNJE{}C and 15\cyrchar\CYRNJE{}C, the host-parasite interaction was much more benign, as nearly all females produced broods before becoming sterile. This association between virulence and temperature alone could stabilize coexistence and lead to the maintenance of diversity, because it would weaken parasite-mediated selection during parts of the season. Additionally, highly significant genotype-by-environment interactions were found, with changes in clone rank order for infection rates at different temperatures. Our results clearly show that the outcome of parasite-mediated selection in this system is strongly context dependent.},

The HotSHOT technique overcomes several of the problems posed by Chelex and permits easy optimization for its use with 96-well plates for high-throughput DNA extraction and subsequent genetic characterization.

Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 \textdegree{}C. These models are at odds with field observations of transmission dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25 \textdegree{}C (6 \textdegree{}C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at temperatures {$>$} 28 \textdegree{}C, altering predictions about how climate change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 \textdegree{}C optimum and the decline above 28 \textdegree{}C. Using these more accurate nonlinear thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission.},

  abstract = {A central prediction of the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is that coevolving interspecific interactions will show varying degrees of local maladaptation. According to the theory, much of this local maladaptation is driven by selection mosaics and spatially intermingled coevolutionary hot and cold spots, rather than a simple balance between gene flow and selection. Here I develop a genetic model of host-parasite coevolution that is sufficiently general to incorporate selection mosaics, coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and a diverse array of genetic systems of infection/resistance. Results from this model show that the selection mosaics experienced by the interacting species are an important determinant of the sign and magnitude of local maladaptation. In some cases, this effect may be stronger than a previously described effect of relative rates of parasite and host gene flow. These results provide the first theoretical evidence that selection mosaics and coevolutionary hot and cold spots per se determine the magnitude and sign of local maladaptation. At the same time, however, these results demonstrate that coevolution in a geographic mosaic can lead to virtually any pattern of local adaptation or local maladaptation. Consequently, empirical studies that describe only patterns of local adaptation or maladaptation do not provide evidence either for or against the theory.},

  abstract = {The outcomes of many species interactions are conditional on the environments in which they occur. Often, interactions grade from being more positive under stressful or low-resource conditions to more antagonistic or neutral under benign conditions. Here, we take predictions about two well-supported ecological theories on conditionality\textemdash{}limiting resource models and the stress-gradient hypothesis\textemdash{}and combine them with those from the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution (GMTC) to generate predictions for systematic patterns of adaptation and coadaptation between partners along abiotic gradients. When interactions become more positive in stressful environments, mutations that increase fitness in one partner may also increase fitness in the other; because fitnesses are aligned, selection should favor greater mutualistic adaptation and coadaptation between interacting species in stressful ends of environmental gradients. As a corollary, in benign environments antagonistic coadaptation could result in Red Queen or arms-race dynamics or the reduction of antagonism through character displacement and niche partitioning. Here, we distinguish between generally mutualistic or antagonistic adaptation (i.e., mutations in one partner that have similar effects across multiple populations of the other) and specific adaptations to sympatric partners (local adaptation), which can occur either alone or simultaneously. We then outline the kinds of data required to test these predictions, develop experimental designs and statistical methods, and demonstrate these using simulations based on GMTC models. Our methods can be applied to a range of conditional outcomes and may also be useful in assisted translocation approaches in the face of climate change.},

Here, we analyze the genetic variation at eight microsatellite loci and sequence variation at exon 2 of the MHC class IIB (DAB) genes in two wild populations of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. We compare the genetic variation of a small (Ne ഠ 100) and relatively isolated upland population to that of its much larger (Ne ഠ 2400) downstream counterpart. As predicted, microsatellite diversity in the upland population is significantly lower and highly differentiated from the population further downstream. Surprisingly, however, these guppy populations are not differentiated by MHC genetic variation and show very similar levels of allelic richness. Computer simulations indicate that the observed level of genetic variation can be maintained with overdominant selection acting at three DAB loci. The selection coefficients differ dramatically between the upland (s Ն 0.2) and lowland (s Յ 0.01) populations. Parasitological analysis on wild-caught fish shows that parasite load is significantly higher on upland than on lowland fish, which suggests that large differences in selection intensity may indeed exist between populations. Based on the infection intensity, a substantial proportion of the upland fish would have suffered direct or indirect fitness consequences as a result of their high parasite loads. Selection by parasites plays a particularly important role in the evolution of guppies in the upland habitat, which has resulted in high levels of MHC diversity being maintained in this population despite considerable genetic drift.},

  abstract = {Utilitarian arguments concerning the value of biodiversity often include the benefits of animals, plants, and microbes as sources of medicines and as laboratory models of disease. The concept that species diversity per se may influence risk of exposure to disease has not been well developed, however. We present a conceptual model of how high species richness and evenness in communities of terrestrial vertebrates may reduce risk of exposure to Lyme disease, a spirochetal ( Borrelia burgdorferi) disease transmitted by ixodid tick vectors. Many ticks never become infected because some hosts are highly inefficient at transmitting spirochete infections to feeding ticks. In North America, the most competent reservoir host for the Lyme disease agent is the white-footed mouse ( Peromyscus leucopus), a species that is widespread and locally abundant. We suggest that increases in species diversity within host communities may dilute the power of white-footed mice to infect ticks by causing more ticks to feed on inefficient disease reservoirs. High species diversity therefore is expected to result in lower prevalence of infection in ticks and consequently in lower risk of human exposure to Lyme disease. Analyses of states and multistate regions along the east coast of the United States demonstrated significant negative correlations between species richness of terrestrial small mammals (orders Rodentia, Insectivora, and Lagomorpha), a key group of hosts for ticks, and per capita numbers of reported Lyme disease cases, which supports our ``dilution effect'' hypothesis. We contrasted these findings to what might be expected when vectors acquire disease agents efficiently from many hosts, in which case infection prevalence of ticks may increase with increasing diversity hosts. A positive correlation between per capita Lyme disease cases and species richness of ground-dwelling birds supported this hypothesis, which we call the ``rescue effect.'' The reservoir competence of hosts within vertebrate communities and the degree of specialization by ticks on particular hosts will strongly influence the relationship between species diversity and the risk of exposure to the many vector-borne diseases that plague humans.},

Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate `realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the `fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing `thermal safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature.},

Such selection on the clonal population is expected to lead to a faster clonal turnover in habitats where selection by parasites is stronger. We tested this prediction by comparing the genetic structure of clonal and sexual populations of freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum between years 2003 and 2007 in three depth-specific habitats in Lake Alexandrina (South Island, New Zealand). These habitats differ in the risk of infection by castrating trematodes and in the relative proportion of sexual individuals. As predicted, we found that the clonal structure changed significantly in shallow and mid-water habitats, where prevalence of infection was high, but not in the deep habitat, where parasite prevalence was low. Additionally, we found that both clonal diversity and evenness of the asexual population declined in the shallow habitat. In contrast, the genetic structure (based on F\textendash{}statistics) of the coexisting sexual population did not change, which suggests that the change in the clonal structure cannot be related to genetic changes in the sexual population. Finally, the frequency of sexuals had no effect on the diversity of the sympatric clonal population. Taken together, our results show a more rapid clonal turnover in high-infection habitats, which gives support for the Red Queen hypothesis for sex.},

Modification of life-history traits in response to parasitism has received less attention than other defence strategies. Life-history theory predicts that parasitised hosts will increase reproductive effort and accelerate reproduction. However, empirical analyses of these predictions are few and mostly limited to animalparasite systems. We have analysed life-history trait responses in 18 accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana infected at two different developmental stages with three strains of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Accessions were divided into two groups according to allometric relationships; these groups differed also in their tolerance to CMV infection. Life-history trait modification upon virus infection depended on the host genotype and the stage at infection. While all accessions delayed flowering, only the more tolerant allometric group modified resource allocation to increase the production of reproductive structures and progeny, and reduced the length of reproductive period. Our results are in agreement with modifications of life-history traits reported for parasitised animals and with predictions from life-history theory. Thus, we provide empirical support for the general validity of theoretical predictions. In addition, this experimental approach allowed us to quantitatively estimate the genetic determinism of life-history trait plasticity and to evaluate the role of life-history trait modification in defence against parasites, two largely unexplored issues.},

In particular, the spatial scale of interactions between pathogens and their hosts is of primary importance because migration rates of one species can affect both spatial and temporal heterogeneity of selection on the other. In this study we developed a stochastic and discrete time simulation model to specifically examine the joint effects of host and pathogen dispersal on the evolution of pathogen specialisation in a spatially explicit metapopulation. We consider a plant-pathogen system in which the host metapopulation is composed of two plant genotypes. The pathogen is dispersed by air-borne spores on the host metapopulation. The pathogen population is characterised by a single life-history trait under selection, the infection efficacy. We found that restricted host dispersal can lead to high amount of pathogen diversity and that the extent of pathogen specialisation varied according to the spatial scale of host-pathogen dispersal. We also discuss the role of population asynchrony in determining pathogen evolutionary outcomes.},

These interactions are often associated with reciprocally induced changes in population size, which, in turn, should have a strong impact on co-adaptation processes, yet are neglected in most current work on the topic. Here, we discuss potential consequences of temporal variations in population size on host\textendash{}parasite coevolution.

The Red Queen Hypothesis postulates that parasite pressure maintains sexual reproduction in the host population by selecting for the ability to produce rare genotypes that are resistant to infection. Mathematical models have been used to lay theoretical foundations for the hypothesis; empirical studies have confirmed these predictions. For example, Lively used a simple host-parasite model to predict that the frequency of sexual hosts should be positively correlated with the prevalence of infection. Lively et al. later confirmed the prediction through numerous field studies of snail-trematode systems in New Zealand. In this study, we fit a simple metapopulation host-parasite coevolution model to three data sets, each representing a different snail-trematode system, by matching the observed prevalence of sexual reproduction and trematode infection among hosts. Using the estimated parameters, we perform a power analysis to test the feasibility of observing the positive correlation predicted by Lively. We discuss anomalies in the data that are poorly explained by the model and provide practical guidance to both modelers and empiricists. Overall, our study suggests that a simple Red Queen model can only partially explain the observed relationships between parasite infection and the maintenance of sexual reproduction.},

From the diverse roles microbes play in natural ecosystems, high levels of functional diversity result. Quantifying this diversity is challenging, because it is weakly associated with morphological differentiation. In addition, the small size of microbes hinders morphological and behavioral measurements at the individual level, as well as interactions between individuals. Advances in microbial community genetics and genomics, flow cytometry and digital analysis of still images are promising approaches. They miss out, however, on a very important aspect of populations and communities: the behavior of individuals. Video analysis complements these methods by providing in addition to abundance and trait measurements, detailed behavioral information, capturing dynamic processes such as movement, and hence has the potential to describe the interactions between individuals. We introduce BEMOVI, a package using the R and ImageJ software, to extract abundance, morphology, and movement data for tens to thousands of individuals in a video. Through a set of functions BEMOVI identifies individuals present in a video, reconstructs their movement trajectories through space and time, and merges this information into a single database. BEMOVI is a modular set of functions, which can be customized to allow for peculiarities of the videos to be analyzed, in terms of organisms features (e.g., morphology or movement) and how they can be distinguished from the background. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of the method with an example on experimental multispecies communities of aquatic protists. We show high correspondence between manual and automatic counts and illustrate how simultaneous time series of abundance, morphology, and behavior are obtained from BEMOVI. We further demonstrate how the trait data can be used with machine learning to automatically classify individuals into species and that information on movement behavior improves the predictive ability.},

In this study, we evaluate the importance of both host and parasite phylogeny in determining the ability of parasites to infect novel host species. Using experimental lab assays, we infected 24 taxonomically diverse species of Drosophila flies (Diptera: Drosophilidae) with five different nematode species (Tylenchida: Allantonematidae: Howardula, Parasitylenchus), and measured parasite infection success, growth, and effects on female host fecundity (i.e., virulence). These nematodes are obligate parasites of mushroom-feeding Drosophila, particularly quinaria and testacea group species, often with severe fitness consequences on their hosts. We show that the potential host ranges of the nematodes are much larger than their actual ranges, even for parasites with only one known host species in nature. Novel hosts that are distantly related from the native host are much less likely to be infected, but among more closely related hosts, there is much variation in susceptibility. Potential host ranges differ greatly between the related parasite species. All nematode species that successfully infected novel hosts produced infective juveniles in these hosts. Most novel infections did not result in significant reductions in the fecundity of female hosts, with one exception: the host specialist Parasitylenchus nearcticus sterilized all quinaria group hosts, only one of which is a host in nature. The large potential host ranges of these parasites, in combination with the high potential for host colonization due to shared mushroom breeding sites, explain the widespread host switching observed in comparisons of nematode and Drosophila phylogenies.},

One possibility is that recombination increases the frequency of advantageous genotypes that are disproportionately rare because of fluctuating epistasis. However, for this mechanism to work, epistasis for fitness must fluctuate over a very narrow timescale: two to five generations. Alternatively, recombination may speed up the response to directional selection by breaking up linkage disequilibria that decrease additive genetic variance. Here we analyze the results of a numerical simulation of host-parasite coevolution to assess the importance of these two mechanisms. We find that linkage disequilibria may tend to increase, rather than decrease, additive genetic variance. In addition, the sign of epistasis changes every two to five generations under several of the parameter values investigated, and epistasis and linkage disequilibrium are frequently of opposite signs. These results are consistent with the idea that selection for recombination is mediated by fluctuating epistasis. Finally, we explore the conditions under which an allele causing free recombination can spread in a nonrecombining host population and find general agreement between the predictions of a population genetic model of fluctuating epistasis and our simulation model.},

  abstract = {We explored the evolution of recombination under antagonistic coevolution, concentrating on the equilibrium frequencies of modifier alleles causing recombination in initially nonrecombining populations. We found that the equilibrium level of recombination in the host depended not only on parasite virulence, but also on the strength of the modifier allele, and on whether or not the modifier was physically linked to the parasite interaction loci. Nonetheless, the maximum level of recombination for linked loci at equilibrium was about 0.3 (60\% of free recombination) for interactions with highly virulent parasites; the level decreased for unlinked modifiers, and for lower levels of parasite virulence. We conclude that recombination spreads because it provides a combination of an immediate (next-generation) fitness benefit and a delayed (two or more generations) increase in the rate of response to directional selection. The relative impact of these two mechanisms depends on the virulence of parasites early in the spread of the modifier, but a trade-off between the two dictates the equilibrium modifier frequency for all nonzero virulences that we examined. In addition, population mean fitness was higher in populations at intermediate equilibria than populations fixed for free recombination or no recombination. The difference, however, was not enough on its own to overcome the two-fold cost of producing males.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological networks are commonly used to explore dynamics of parasite transmission among individuals in a population of a given host species. However, many parasites infect multiple host species, and thus multi-host networks may offer a better framework for investigating parasite dynamics. We investigated the factors that influence parasite sharing \textendash{} and thus potential transmission pathways \textendash{} among rodent hosts in Southeast Asia. We focused on differences between networks of a single host species and networks that involve multiple host species. In host-parasite networks, modularity (the extent to which the network is divided to subgroups composed of individuals that interact more among themselves than with individuals outside the subgroup) was higher in the multi-species than in the single-species networks. This suggests that phylogeny affects patterns of parasite sharing, which was confirmed in analyses showing that it predicted affiliation of individuals to modules. We then constructed ``potential transmission networks'' based on the host-parasite networks, in which edges depict the number of parasites shared between a pair of individuals. The centrality of individuals in these networks differed between multi- and single-species networks, with species identity and individual characteristics influencing their position in the networks. Simulations further revealed that parasite dynamics differed between multi- and single-species networks. We conclude that multi-host networks based on parasite sharing can provide new insights into the potential for transmission among hosts in an ecological community. In addition, the factors that determine the nature of parasite sharing (i.e. structure of the host-parasite network) may impact transmission patterns.},

We sequenced the genome of Ordospora colligata, a gut parasite of the microcrustacean Daphnia sp. and the closest known relative to the microsporidia characterized by the most extreme genomic reduction, the model genus Encephalitozoon. We found that the O. colligata genome is as compact as those of Encephalitozoon spp., featuring few introns and a similar complement of about 2,000 genes, altogether showing that the extreme reduction took place before the origin of Encephalitozoon spp. and their adaptation to vertebrate hosts. We also found that the O. colligata genome has acquired by horizontal transfer from its animal host a septin that is structurally analogous to septin 7, a protein that plays a major role in the endocytosis-based invasion mechanism of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Microsporidian invasion is most often characterized by injection through a projectile tube, but microsporidia are also known to invade cells by inducing endocytosis. Given the function of septins in other systems, we hypothesize that the acquired septin could help O. colligata induce its uptake by mimicking host receptors. IMPORTANCE The smallest known eukaryotic genomes are found in members of the Encephalitozoon genus of microsporidian parasites. Their extreme compaction, however, is not characteristic of the group, whose genomes can differ by an order of magnitude. The processes and evolutionary forces that led the Encephalitozoon genomes to shed so much of their ancestral baggage are unclear. We sequenced the genome of Ordospora colligata, a parasite of the water flea Daphnia sp. and the closest known relative of Encephalitozoon species, and show that this extreme reduction predated the split between the two lineages. We also found that O. colligata has acquired a septin gene by host-to-parasite horizontal transfer and predicted that the encoded protein folds like a septin 7, which plays a major role in endocytosis. We hypothesize that this acquisition could help O. colligata parasitize its hosts by facilitating endocytic infection, a mechanism that occurs in microsporidia but that is not yet well understood.},

  abstract = {Evidence is accumulating rapidly showing that temperature and other climatic variables are driving many ecological processes. At the same time, recent research has highlighted the role of parasitism in the dynamics of animal populations and the structure of animal communities. Here, the likely interactions between climate change and parasitism are discussed in the context of intertidal ecosystems. Firstly, using the soft-sediment intertidal communities of Otago Harbour, New Zealand, as a case study, parasites are shown to be ubiquitous components of intertidal communities, found in practically all major animal species in the system. With the help of specific examples from Otago Harbour, it is demonstrated that parasites can regulate host population density, influence the diversity of the entire benthic community, and affect the structure of the intertidal food web. Secondly, we document the extreme sensitivity of cercarial production in parasitic trematodes to increases in temperature, and discuss how global warming could lead to enhanced trematode infections. Thirdly, the results of a simulation model are used to argue that parasitemediated local extinctions of intertidal animals are a likely outcome of global warming. Specifically, the model predicts that following a temperature increase of less than 48C, populations of the amphipod Corophium volutator, a hugely abundant tube-building amphipod on the mudflats of the Danish Wadden Sea, are likely to crash repeatedly due to mortality induced by microphallid trematodes. The available evidence indicates that climate-mediated changes in local parasite abundance will have significant repercussions for intertidal ecosystems. On the bright side, the marked effects of even slight increases in temperature on cercarial production in trematodes could form the basis for monitoring programmes, with these sensitive parasites providing early warning signals of the environmental impacts of global warming.},

We examined the population genetic structure of the trematode Schistosoma mansoni and its two host species (the definitive host Rattus rattus and the intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata) using microsatellite markers. Parasites were sampled from rats. The study was conducted in five sites of the Guadeloupe Island, Lesser Antilles. Mollusks display a pattern of isolation by distance whereas such a pattern is not found neither in schistosomes nor in rats. The comparison of the distribution of genetic variability in S. mansoni and its two host species strongly suggests that migration of parasites is principally determined by that of the vertebrate host in the marshy focus of Guadeloupe. However, the comparison between genetic differentiation values in schistosomes and rats suggests that the efficacy of the schistosome rat-mediated dispersal between transmission sites is lower than expected given the prevalence, parasitic load and migration rate of rats among sites. This could notably suggest that rat migration rate could be negatively correlated to the age or the infection status of individuals. Models made about the evolution of local adaptation in function of the dispersal rates of hosts and parasites suggest that rats and mollusks should be locally adapted to their parasites.},

  abstract = {Accurate inferences on population genetics data require a sound underlying theoretical null model. Organisms alternating sexual and asexual reproduction during their life-cycle have been largely neglected in theoretical population genetic models, thus limiting the biological interpretation of population genetics parameters measured in natural populations. In this article, we derive the expectations of those parameters for the life-cycle of monoecious trematodes, a group comprising several important human and livestock parasites that obligatorily alternate sexual and asexual reproduction during their life-cycle. We model how migration rates between hosts, sexual and asexual mutation rates, adult selfing rate and the variance in reproductive success of parasites during the clonal phase affect the amount of neutral genetic diversity of the parasite (effective population size) and its apportionment within and between definitive hosts (using F-statistics). We demonstrate, in particular, that variance in reproductive success of clones, a parameter that has been completely overlooked in previous population genetics models, is very important in shaping the distribution of the genetic variability both within and among definitive hosts. Within definitive hosts, the parameter FIS (a measure of the deviation from random mating) is decreased by high variance in clonal reproductive success of larvae but increased by high adult self-fertilisation rates. Both clonal multiplication and selfing have similar effects on between-host genetic differentiation (FST). Migration occurring before and after asexual reproduction can have different effects on the patterns of FIS, depending on values of the other parameters such as the mutation rate. While the model applies to any hermaphroditic organism alternating sexual and clonal reproduction (e.g. many plants), the results are specifically discussed in the light of the limited population genetic data on monoecious trematodes available to date and their previous interpretation. We hope that our model will encourage more empirical population genetics studies on monoecious trematodes and other organisms with similar life-cycles.},

The canonical Red Queen dynamics assume that all interacting genotypes of hosts and parasites undergo cyclic changes in abundance through negative frequency-dependent selection, which means that any genotype could become frequent at some stage. However, this prediction cannot explain why many rare genotypes stay rare in natural host-parasite systems. To investigate this, we build a mathematical model involving multihost and multiparasite genotypes. In a deterministic and controlled environment, Red Queen dynamics occur between two genotypes undergoing cyclic dominance changes, whereas the rest of the genotypes remain subordinate for long periods of time in phase-locked synchronized dynamics with low amplitude. However, introduction of stochastic noise in the model might allow the subordinate cyclic host and parasite types to replace dominant cyclic types as new players in the Red Queen dynamics. The factors that influence such evolutionary switching are interhost competition, specificity of parasitism, and degree of stochastic noise. Our model can explain, for the first time, the persistence of rare, hardly cycling genotypes in populations (for example, marine microbial communities) undergoing host-parasite coevolution.},

The basic idea is that by diluting the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The same principle has recently been applied to other infectious disease systems \textendash{} tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is claimed that the presence of extra species of various sorts, acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the correct metric \textendash{} abundance rather than prevalence of infected vectors. Whether dilution or amplification occurs depends more on specific community composition than on biodiversity per se. We warn against raising a straw man, an untenable argument easily dismantled and dismissed. The intrinsic value of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem function outweighs this questionable utilitarian justification.},

Complex life cycles using three host species, free-living stages, asexual and sexual reproduction are widespread in parasitic helminths. For such life cycles, we propose here that maintaining a second intermediate host in the life cycle can be advantageous for the individual parasite to increase the intermixture of different clones and therefore decrease the risk of matings between genetically identical individuals in the definitive host. Using microsatellite markers, we show that clone mixing occurs from the first to the second intermediate host in natural populations of the eye-fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum. Most individuals released by the first intermediate host belonged to one clone. In contrast, the second intermediate host was infected with a diverse array of mostly unique parasite genotypes. The proposed advantage of increased parasite clone intermixture may be a novel selection pressure favouring the maintenance of complex life cycles.},

  abstract = {Population viability analysis (PVA) has become a commonly used tool in endangered species management. There is no single process that constitutes PVA, but all approaches have in common an assessment of a population's risk of extinction (or quasi extinction) or its projected population growth either under current conditions or expected from proposed management. As model sophistication increases, and software programs that facilitate PVA without the need for modeling expertise become more available, there is greater potential for the misuse of models and increased confusion over interpreting their results. Consequently, we discuss the practical use and limitations of PVA in conservation planning, and we discuss some emerging issues of PVA. We review extant issues that have become prominent in PVA, including spatially explicit modeling, sensitivity analysis, incorporating genetics into PVA, PVA in plants, and PVA software packages, but our coverage of emerging issues is not comprehensive. We conclude that PVA is a powerful tool in conservation biology for comparing alternative research plans and relative extinction risks among species, but we suggest caution in its use: (1) because PVA is a model, its validity depends on the appropriateness of the model's structure and data quality; (2) results should be presented with appropriate assessment of confidence; (3) model construction and results should be subject to external review, and (4) model structure, input, and results should be treated as hypotheses to be tested. We also suggest (5) restricting the definition of PVA to development of a formal quantitative model, (6) focusing more research on determining how pervasive densitydependence feedback is across species, and (7) not using PVA to determine minimum population size or (8) the specific probability of reaching extinction. The most appropriate use of PVA may be for comparing the relative effects of potential management actions on population growth or persistence.},

G. intestinalis, Microsporidium sp. and O. colligata, which are horizontally transmitted gut parasites with small spores and low virulence, group with different lineages. G. intestinalis is related to 2 microsporidia infecting lepidopterans and to Vittaforma corneae, which has been described as a human pathogen. It is thought that V. corneae may have an invertebrate as its natural host. Microsporidium sp. is a relative of the genera Enterocytozoon and Nucleospora, pathogens of man and fish respectively. O. colligata is the first species found to be closely related to the genus Encephalitozoon, which is comprised of 3 species that are parasites of homeothermic vertebrates. G. vavrai and L. obtusa are sister taxa that branch close to the Amblyosporidae, the only microsporidia with known intermediate hosts. This finding supports the presumption of secondary hosts for G. vavrai and L. obtusa, as it has not been possible to maintain these species in Daphnia in the laboratory. F. magnivora roots deep at the base of the phylum microsporidia with no close relative found so far.},

  abstract = {Reliable detection, discrimination and quantification of parasites are important for host-parasite studies and diagnostics. Microsporidial infections are problematic in this respect. Their discrimination and quantification using light microscopy is difficult because spores are the only light microscopically visible form of the parasite and they offer few distinct characters. We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay based on SYBR Green chemistry to quantify the microsporidia Glugoides intestinalis, Octosporea bayeri and Ordospora colligata in their host, the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. The assay allows the quantification of infection intensities in whole animals and is more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than light microscopy. Sampling and DNA extraction account for more than 90 \% of the residual variance in infection intensity data and this variance considerably impairs the resolution of qPCR. Where higher resolution is required, we propose using the ratio of parasite to host DNA as the measure of infection intensity. We show that this measure is robust and greatly improves resolution of qPCR. Additionally, this method can be applied to compare samples of unequal volume.},

  abstract = {Estimating parasite fitness is central to studies aiming to understand parasite evolution. Theoretical models generally use the basic reproductive rate R0 to express fitness, yet it is very difficult to quantify R0 empirically and experimental studies often use fitness components such as infection intensity or infectivity as substitutes. These surrogate measures may be biased in several ways. We assessed local adaptation of the microsporidium Ordospora colligata to its host, the crustacean Daphnia magna using two different parasite fitness components: infection persistence over several host generations in experimental populations and infection intensity in individual hosts. We argue that infection persistence is a close estimator of R0, whereas infection intensity measures only a component of it. Both measures show a pattern that is consistent with parasite local adaptation and they correlate positively. However, several inconsistencies between them suggest that infection intensity may at times provide an inadequate estimate of parasite fitness.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary studies often estimate fitness components with the aim to make predictions about the outcome of selection. Depending on the system and the question, different fitness components are used, but their usefulness for predicting the outcome of selection is rarely tested. Here we estimate host fitness components in different ways with the aim to test how well they agree with each other and how well they predict host fitness at the population level in the presence of the parasite. We use a Daphnia magna-microparasite system to study the competitive ability of host clones in the absence and presence of the parasite, the infection intensity of the parasite in individuals of twelve host clones (an estimate of both host resistance and parasite reproductive success), and parasite persistence in small host populations (an estimate of R0 of the parasite). Analysis of host competitive ability and parasite persistence reveals strong host genotype effects, while none are found for infection intensity. Host competitive ability further shows a genotype-specific change upon infection, which is correlated with the relative persistence of the parasite in the competing hosts. Hosts in which the parasite persists better suffer a competitive disadvantage in the parasite's presence. This suggests that in this system, parasite-mediated selection can be predicted by parasite persistence, but not by parasite infection intensity.},

  abstract = {Vertebrate hosts often defend themselves against several co-infecting parasite genotypes simultaneously. This has important implications for the ecological dynamics and the evolution of host defence systems and parasite strategies. For example, it can drive the specificity of the adaptive immune system towards high genotype-specificity or crossreactivity against several parasite genotypes depending on the sequence and probability of re-infections. However, to date, there is very little evidence on these interactions outside mammalian disease literature. In this study we asked whether genotype-specific or cross-reactive responses dominate in the adaptive immune system of a fish host towards a common macroparasite. In other words, we investigated if the infection success of a parasite genotype is influenced by the immunization genotype. We reciprocally immunized and re-exposed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to a range of genotypes of the trematode eye fluke Diplostomum pseudospathaceum, and measured infection success of the parasite. We found that the infection success of the parasite genotypes in the re-exposure did not depend on the immunization genotype. While immunization reduced average infection success by 31\%, the reduction was not larger against the initial immunization genotype. Our results suggest significant cross-reactivity, which may be advantageous for the host in genetically diverse re-exposures and have significant evolutionary implications for parasite strategies. Overall, our study is among the first to demonstrate cross-reactivity of adaptive immunity against genetically diverse macroparasites with complex life cycles.},

Partial eta squared is a similar measure in which the effects of other independent variables and interactions are partialled out. The development of these measures is described and their characteristics compared. In the past, the two measures have been confused in the research literature, partly because of a labelling error in the output produced by certain versions of the statistical package SPSS. Nowadays, partial eta squared is overwhelmingly cited as a measure of effect size in the educational research literature. Although there are good reasons for this, the interpretation of both measures needs to be undertaken with care. The paper concludes with a summary of the key characteristics of eta squared and partial eta squared.},

  abstract = {Graph and Complex Network theory is expanding its application to different levels of matter organization such as molecular, biological, technological, and social networks. A network is a set of items, usually called nodes, with connections between them, which are called links or edges. There are many different experimental and/or theoretical methods to assign node\textendash{}node links depending on the type of network we want to construct. Unfortunately, the use of a method for experimental reevaluation of the entire network is very expensive in terms of time and resources; thus the development of cheaper theoretical methods is of major importance. In addition, different methods to link nodes in the same type of network are not totally accurate in such a way that they do not always coincide. In this sense, the development of computational methods useful to evaluate connectivity quality in complex networks (a posteriori of network assemble) is a goal of major interest. In this work, we report for the first time a new method to calculate numerical quality scores S(Lij) for network links Lij (connectivity) based on the Markov\textendash{}Shannon Entropy indices of order k-th (yk) for network nodes. The algorithm may be summarized as follows: (i) first, the yk(j) values are calculated for all j-th nodes in a complex network already constructed; (ii) A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to seek a linear equation that discriminates connected or linked (Lij\textonequarter{} 1) pairs of nodes experimentally confirmed from non-linked ones (Lij\textonequarter{}0); (iii) the new model is validated with external series of pairs of nodes; (iv) the equation obtained is used to re-evaluate the connectivity quality of the network, connecting/ disconnecting nodes based on the quality scores calculated with the new connectivity function. This method was used to study different types of large networks. The linear models obtained produced the following results in terms of overall accuracy for network reconstruction: Metabolic networks (72.3\%), Parasite\textendash{}Host networks (93.3\%), CoCoMac brain cortex co-activation network (89.6\%), NW Spain fasciolosis spreading network (97.2\%), Spanish financial law network (89.9\%) and World trade network for Intelligent \& Active Food Packaging (92.8\%). In order to seek these models, we studied an average of 55,388 pairs of nodes in each model and a total of 332,326 pairs of nodes in all models. Finally, this method was used to solve a more complicated problem. A model was developed to score the connectivity quality in the Drug\textendash{}Target network of US FDA approved drugs. In this last model the yk values were calculated for three types of molecular networks representing different levels of organization: drug molecular graphs (atom\textendash{}atom bonds), protein residue networks (amino acid interactions), and drug\textendash{}target network (compound\textendash{}protein binding). The overall accuracy of this model was 76.3\%. This work opens a new door to the computational reevaluation of network connectivity quality (collation) for complex systems in molecular, biomedical, technological, and legal\textendash{}social sciences as well as in world trade and industry.},

Simple flotation failed to give satisfactory results with any samples. Overall, FLOTAC resulted in similar or higher eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) and lower coefficient of variation (CV) than McMaster. The ``gold standard'' for D. dendriticum was obtained with FLOTAC when using FS7 (EPG = 219, CV = 3.9\%) and FS8 (EPG = 226, CV = 5.2\%) on fresh faeces. The ``gold standard'' for M. expansa was obtained with FLOTAC, using FS3 (EPG = 122, CV = 4.1\%) on fresh faeces. The ``gold standard'' for GI strongyles was obtained with FLOTAC when using FS5 (EPG = 320, CV = 4\%) and FS2 (EPG = 298, CV = 5\%). As regard to faecal preservation methods, formalin 5\% and 10\% or freezing showed performance similar to fresh faeces for eggs of D. dendriticum and M. expansa. However, these methods of preservation were not as successful with GI strongyle eggs. Vacuum packing with storage at +4 {$\smwhtcircle$}C permitted storage of GI strongyle eggs for up to 21 days prior to counting. Where accurate egg counts are required in ovine samples the optimum method of counting is the use of FLOTAC. In addition, we suggest the use of two solutions that are easy and cheap to purchase and prepare, saturated sodium chloride (FS2) for nematoda and cestoda eggs and saturated zinc sulphate (FS7) for trematoda eggs and nematoda larvae.},

Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a fooddependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role. The influence of "growth-curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics. The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of sexual reproduction remains one of the major puzzles of evolutionary biology, since, all else being equal, an asexual mutant should have a twofold fitness advantage over the sexual wildtype. Most theories suggest that sex helps either to purge deleterious mutations, or to adapt to changing environments. Both mechanisms have their limitations if they act in isolation because they require either high genomic mutation rates or very virulent pathogens, and it is therefore often thought that they must act together to maintain sex. Typically, however, these theories have in common that they are not based on spatial processes. Here, we show that local dispersal and local competition can explain the maintenance of sexual reproduction as a means of purging deleterious mutations. Using a spatially explicit individual-based model, we find that even with reasonably low genomic mutation rates and large total population sizes, asexual clones cannot invade a sexual population. Our results demonstrate how spatial processes affect mutation accumulation such that it can fully erode the twofold benefit of asexuality faster than an asexual clone can take over a sexual population. Thus, the cost of sex is generally overestimated in models that ignore the effects of space on mutation accumulation.},

However, previous theoretical studies have shown that the Red Queen typically selects against sex unless selection is strong, arguing that high rates of recombination cannot evolve when parasites are of low virulence. Here we show that under the biologically plausible assumption of a severe fitness cost for parasites that fail to infect, the Red Queen can cause selection for high recombination rates, and that the strength of virulence is largely irrelevant to the direction of selection for increased recombination rates. Strong selection on parasites and short generation times make parasites usually better adapted to their hosts than vice versa and can thus favor higher recombination rates in hosts. By demonstrating the importance of host-imposed selection on parasites, our findings resolve previously reported conflicting results.},

Genetic recombination might outweigh these costs if it helps to escape parasite pressure by creating rare or novel genotypes, an idea known as the Red Queen Hypothesis. Selection for recombination can be driven by short-term and long-term effects, but the relative importance of these effects and their dependency on the parameters of an antagonistic species interaction remain unclear. We use computer simulations of a mathematical model of host-parasite coevolution to measure those effects under a wide range of parameters. We find that the real driving force underlying the Red Queen Hypothesis is neither the immediate, next generation short-term effect nor the long term effect, but in fact a delayed short-term effect. Our results highlight the importance to differentiate clearly between the immediate and the delayed short-term effect when attempting to elucidate the mechanism underlying selection for recombination in the Red Queen Hypothesis.},

A cross-infection experiment, using five lines of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and two strains of its oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica, revealed that three traits traditionally considered those of the parasite (number of infected leaves, transmission success, and time until 50\% transmission), differed among specific combinations of host and parasite lines, being determined by the two protagonists of the infection. However, the two parasite strains did not differ significantly for most measured phenotypic traits of the infection. Globally, transmission increased with increasing virulence among the different host-parasite combinations, as assumed by most models of evolution of virulence. Surprisingly, however, there was no general relationship between parasite and host fitness, estimated respectively as transmission and seed production. Only one of the two strains showed the expected significant negative genetic correlation between these two variables. Our results thus highlight the importance of taking into account both host and parasite genetic variation because their interaction can lead to unexpected evolutionary outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Red Queen dynamics are defined as long term co-evolutionary dynamics, often with oscillations of genotype abundances driven by fluctuating selection in host-parasite systems. Much of our current understanding of these dynamics is based on theoretical concepts explored in mathematical models that are mostly (i) deterministic, inferring an infinite population size and (ii) evolutionary, thus ecological interactions that change population sizes are excluded. Here, we recall the different mathematical approaches used in the current literature on Red Queen dynamics. We then compare models from game theory (evo) and classical theoretical ecology models (eco-evo), that are all derived from individual interactions and are thus intrinsically stochastic. We assess the influence of this stochasticity through the time to the first loss of a genotype within a host or parasite population.
Results: The time until the first genotype is lost (``extinction time''), is shorter when ecological dynamics, in the form of a changing population size, is considered. Furthermore, when individuals compete only locally with other individuals extinction is even faster. On the other hand, evolutionary models with a fixed population size and competition on the scale of the whole population prolong extinction and therefore stabilise the oscillations. The stabilising properties of intra-specific competitions become stronger when population size is increased and the deterministic part of the dynamics gain influence. In general, the loss of genotype diversity can be counteracted with mutations (or recombination), which then allow the populations to recurrently undergo negative frequency-dependent selection dynamics and selective sweeps.
Conclusion: Although the models we investigated are equal in their biological motivation and interpretation, they have diverging mathematical properties both in the derived deterministic dynamics and the derived stochastic dynamics. We find that models that do not consider intraspecific competition and that include ecological dynamics by letting the population size vary, lose genotypes \textendash{} and thus Red Queen oscillations \textendash{} faster than models with competition and a fixed population size.},

  abstract = {Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that reside in nonhuman animal reservoirs and are transmitted to humans via the bite of an arthropod vector. Most vectors feed from a variety of host species that differ dramatically in their reservoir competence; that is, their probability of transmitting the infection from host to vector. We explore a conceptual model of what we termed the ``dilution effect,'' whereby the presence of vertebrate hosts with a low capacity to infect feeding vectors (incompetent reservoirs) dilute the effect of highly competent reservoirs, thus reducing disease risk. Using Lyme disease as an example, we demonstrate the presence and estimate the magnitude of the dilution effect for local sites in eastern New York State. We found that the prevalence of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi, in field-collected Ixodes ticks (37.6\% and 70.5\% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) was dramatically lower than expected (ϳ90\% and Ͼ95\% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) if ticks fed predominantly on highly competent reservoirs, white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). We inferred the role of additional host species using an empirically based model that incorporated data on tick burdens per host, relative population densities of hosts, and reservoir competence of each host. Assuming an empirically realistic reservoir competence of 5\% for non-mouse and non-chipmunk hosts, we determined that alternative hosts must provide 61\% and 72\% of larval and nymphal meals, respectively. Using computer simulations, we assembled simulated host communities that differed in species richness, evenness, and net interactions between alternative hosts and mice. We found that increasing species richness (but not evenness) reduced disease risk. Effects were most pronounced when the most competent disease reservoirs were community dominants and when alternative hosts had a net negative influence on the dominance of mice as a host for ticks. Our results highlight a critical role of biodiversity and host community ecology in the transmission of vector-borne zoonotic diseases that in turn has important consequences for human health.},

The studies covered a wide range of taxa in various terrestrial systems with varying degrees of species diversity. We quantified the average magnitude of direct effects of carnivores on herbivore prey and indirect effects of carnivores on plants. We examined how the effect magnitudes varied with type of carnivores in the study system, food web diversity, and experimental protocol. A metaanalysis of the data revealed that trophic cascades were common among the studies. Exceptions to this general trend did arise. In some cases, trophic cascades were expected not to occur, and they did not. In other cases, the direct effects of carnivores on herbivores were stronger than the indirect effects of carnivores on plants, indicating that top-down effects attenuated. Top-down effects usually attenuated whenever plants contained antiherbivore defenses or when herbivore species diversity was high. Conclusions about the strength of top-down effects of carnivores varied with the type of carnivore and with the plant-response variable measured. Vertebrate carnivores generally had stronger effects than invertebrate carnivores. Carnivores, in general, had stronger effects when the response was measured as plant damage rather than as plant biomass or plant reproductive output. We caution, therefore, that conclusions about the strength of top-down effects could be an artifact of the plant-response variable measured. We also found that mesocosm experiments generally had weaker effect magnitudes than open-plot field experiments or observational experiments. Trophic cascades in terrestrial systems, although not a universal phenomenon, are a consistent response throughout the published studies reviewed here. Our analysis thus suggests that they occur more frequently in terrestrial systems than currently believed. Moreover, the mechanisms and strengths of topdown effects of carnivores are equivalent to those found in other types of systems (e.g., aquatic environments).},

Such specificity, however, is still generally poorly understood. We examined genetic specificity in interactions among coinfecting parasites. In natural populations, individual hosts are often simultaneously infected by multiple parasite species and genotypes that interact. Such interactions could maintain genetic variation in parasite populations if they are genetically specific so that the relative fitness of parasite genotypes varies across host individuals depending on (1) the presence/absence of coinfections and/or (2) the genetic composition of the coinfecting parasite community. We tested these predictions using clones of fish eye flukes Diplostomum pseudospathaceum and Diplostomum gasterostei. We found that interactions among parasites had a strong genetic basis and that this modified genetic variation in infection success of D. pseudospathaceum between single and multiple infections as well as across multiply infected host individuals depending on the genetic identity of the coinfecting D. gasterostei. The relative magnitude of these effects, however, depended on the exposure dose, suggesting that ecological factors can modify genetic interactions between parasites.},

In this review, we describe the original framework for EGT and the major work that has followed it. This review looks at the calculation of the ``fixation probability'' \textendash{} the probability of a mutant taking over a population and focuses on game-theoretic applications. We look at varying topics such as alternate evolutionary dynamics, time to fixation, special topological cases, and game theoretic results. Throughout the review, we examine several interesting open problems that warrant further research.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory studies the evolutionary dynamics of populations structured on graphs. A central problem is determining the probability that a small number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo simulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general directed graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we introduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities for strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral drift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected number of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that the graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models (e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for fixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be used to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide various experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected number of mutants on different graphs. Among these, we show that our method consistently outperforms Monte Carlo simulations in speed by several orders of magnitude. Finally we show how our approach can provide insight into synaptic competition in neurology.},

Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to test the significance of genetic differentiation between populations. Both methods gave similar results. Of total gene diversity, 15n1 \% (AMOVA) and 18n8 \% (CCA) was partitioned between localities for S. mansoni with an absence of association between genetic and geographical distances. Geographical localities accounted for 20n5 \% (CCA) of the total diversity for B. glabrata populations. The genetic distances between pairs of parasite populations were not correlated with the genetic distances between the corresponding pairs of snail host populations. Such strong patterns of local differentiation of both parasite and snail populations are consistent with predictions based on metapopulation dynamics and may have implications on host\textendash{}parasite susceptibility relationship through local adaptation processes.},

  abstract = {Population genetic theory predicts that plant populations will exhibit internal spatial autocorrelation when propagule \textasciimacron{}ow is restricted, but as an empirical reality, spatial structure is rarely consistent across loci or sites, and is generally weak. A lack of sensitivity in the statistical procedures may explain the discrepancy. Most work to date, based on allozymes, has involved pattern analysis for individual alleles, but new PCR-based genetic markers are coming into vogue, with vastly increased numbers of alleles. The \textregistered{}eld is badly in need of an explicitly multivariate approach to autocorrelation analysis, and our purpose here is to introduce a new approach that is applicable to multiallelic codominant, multilocus arrays. The procedure treats the genetic data set as a whole, strengthening the spatial signal and reducing the stochastic (allele-to-allele, and locus-to-locus) noise. We (i) develop a very general multivariate method, based on genetic distance methods, (ii) illustrate it for multiallelic codominant loci, and (iii) provide nonparametric permutational testing procedures for the full correlogram. We illustrate the new method with an example data set from the orchid Caladenia tentaculata, for which we show (iv) how the multivariate treatment compares with the single-allele treatment, (v) that intermediate frequency alleles from highly polymorphic loci perform well and rare alleles poorly, (vi) that a multilocus treatment provides clearer answers than separate single-locus treatments, and (vii) that weighting alleles dierentially improves our resolution minimally. The results, though speci\textregistered{}c to Caladenia, oer encouragement for wider application.},

  abstract = {Bioclimatic envelope models of species' responses to climate change are used to predict how species will respond to increasing temperatures. These models are frequently based on the assumption that the northern and southern boundaries of a species' range define its thermal niche. However, this assumption may be violated if populations are adapted to local temperature regimes and have evolved population-specific thermal optima. Considering the prevalence of local adaptation, the assumption of a species-wide thermal optimum may be violated for many species. We used spatially and temporally extensive demographic data for American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) to examine range-wide variation in response of population growth rate ({$\lambda$}) to climatic factors. Our results suggest adaptation to local temperature, but not precipitation. For each population, {$\lambda$} was maximized when annual temperatures were similar to site-specific, long-term mean temperatures. Populations from disparate climatic zones responded differently to temperature variation, and there was a linear relation between population-level thermal optima and the 30-year mean temperature at each site. For species that are locally adapted to temperature, bioclimatic envelope models may underestimate the extent to which increasing temperatures will decrease population growth rate. Because any directional change from long-term mean temperatures will decrease population growth rates, all populations throughout a species' range will be adversely affected by temperature increase, not just populations at southern and low-elevation boundaries. Additionally, when a species' local thermal niche is narrower than its range-wide thermal niche, a smaller temperature increase than would be predicted by bioclimatic envelope approaches may be sufficient to decrease population growth.},

  abstract = {Most mathematical models on the evolution of virulence are based on epidemiological models that assume parasite transmission follows the mass action principle. In experimental evolution, however, mass action is often violated due to controlled infection protocols. This ``theory\textendash{}experiment mismatch'' raises the question whether there is a need for new mathematical models to accommodate the particular characteristics of experimental evolution. Here, we explore the experimental evolution model system of Bacillus thuringiensis as a parasite and Caenorhabditis elegans as a host. Recent experimental studies with strict control of parasite transmission revealed that one-sided adaptation of B. thuringiensis with non-evolving hosts selects for intermediate or no virulence, sometimes coupled with parasite extinction. In contrast, host\textendash{}parasite coevolution selects for high virulence and for hosts with strong resistance against B. thuringiensis. In order to explain the empirical results, we propose a new mathematical model that mimics the basic experimental set-up. The key assumptions are: (i) controlled parasite transmission (no mass action), (ii) discrete host generations, and (iii) context-dependent cost of toxin production. Our model analysis revealed the same basic trends as found in the experiments. Especially, we could show that resistant hosts select for highly virulent bacterial strains. Moreover, we found (i) that the evolved level of virulence is independent of the initial level of virulence, and (ii) that the average amount of bacteria ingested significantly affects the evolution of virulence with fewer bacteria ingested selecting for highly virulent strains. These predictions can be tested in future experiments. This study highlights the usefulness of custom-designed mathematical models in the analysis and interpretation of empirical results from experimental evolution.},

However, our understanding of the effects of environmental factors on marine host \textendash{}parasite systems is limited. We conducted a series of laboratory experiments on the effects of temperature on all transmission steps of the intertidal trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis from its first intermediate snail host Zeacumantus subcarinatus to the second intermediate amphipod host Paracalliope novizealandiae. By measuring output of cercarial transmission stages from snails, cercarial survival and infectivity, susceptibility of amphipods to infections, amphipod survival and parasite development within amphipods, we evaluated overall net temperature effects. At low temperatures ({$<$} 20\textdegree{}C), transmission was low and amphipod survival unaffected. At intermediate temperatures (20 to 25\textdegree{}C), output and infectivity of cercarial transmission stages was at an optimum, which may increase the risk of infection intensity-dependent mortality of amphipods. Also, temperature directly increased amphipod mortality, but accelerated parasite development within amphipods. At high temperatures ({$\geq$}30\textdegree{}C), transmission of the parasite was reduced (few cercariae, low infectivity), but temperatureinduced mortality of amphipods was most pronounced. Our approach revealed that temperature strongly, but differentially, affects the various steps of the transmission process, pointing to the amphipod as the most vulnerable component. An increased impact of parasites on amphipod populations with global warming is predicted and the possible disruption of the host \textendash{}parasite system seems realistic under unusual future circumstances such as prolonged heatwaves. We suggest that more holistic studies of host \textendash{}parasite interactions are essential for a better understanding of potential responses of host \textendash{}parasite systems to global changes.},

Using a cellular automaton model, we here explore the effect of pathogenic infection on the spatial dynamics of species that also engage in intraguild predation (IGP) in a fragmented landscape. First, the shared pathogen by the predator and prey can enhance species coexistence in the IGP system, consistent with results for nonspatial IGP systems. Second, equilibrium population sizes of the predator and prey depend crucially on the pathogen virulence to the predator but are insensitive to the change in the virulence to the prey. This asymmetric response to virulence change is due to the fact that the predator species has to juggle between predation, resource competition and pathogenic infection. Finally, the response of the pathogen to habitat fragmentation is largely determined by its life-history strategy (transmissibility and virulence) and the trophic level of its host. These results enrich our understanding on the role of pathogens in the ecosystem functioning of eco-epidemiological systems.},

Host body condition, nutrition and disease susceptibility interact in a complex manner, and while the individual effects of these variables are well known, our understanding of how they interact and translate to population dynamics is limited. Our objective was to determine whether host relative body condition influences epidemic dynamics, and how this relationship is affected by food availability. Poecilia reticulata (guppies) of roughly similar size were selected and assembled randomly into populations of 10 guppies assigned to 3 different food availability treatments, and the relative condition index (Kn) of each fish was calculated. We infected 1 individual per group (`source' fish) with Gyrodactyus turnbulli and counted parasites on each fish every other day for 10 days. Epidemic parameters for each population were analysed using generalized linear models. High host Kn\textemdash{}particularly that of the `source' fish\textemdash{}exerted a positive effect on incidence, peak parasite burden, and the degree of parasite aggregation. Low food availability increased the strength of the associations with peak burden and aggregation. Our findings suggest that host Kn and food availability interact to influence epidemic dynamics, and that the condition of the individual that brings the parasite into the host population has a profound impact on the spread of infection.},

This protozoon elicits the formation of large, spore-filled, hypertrophied host cells, cysts. Previous reports of microsporidia in European lophiidsidentifythe parasite as S p r u p u lophii, a genus which has recently been shown to be dimorphic. The spores from L. umericunur are monomorphic (2.8 x 1.5 pm) and uninuclcate. Each spore contains a polar tube that forms six to nine coils. Sprugueu Iophii differs from the microsporidium described in L. umericunus in several ways. Sprugueu lophii has two spore types: a large spore (4.0 x 1.25 pm) containing a diplokaryon and thrcc to four polar tube coils and a smaller uninucleate spore (3.5 x 1.5 pm) with five to six polar tube coils. Because of these major differences,the microsporidium from L. umericunus is removed from the genus Sprugueu and returned to its original genus, Glugeu, as a new species, G. umericunus n. sp. Other ultrastructuralcharacteristicsof G. umericunus are included: the posterior vacuole encloses two distinct membranous structures;one is tubular and resembles a ``glomerulartuft`` and the m n d is lamellar and composed of concentric membrane whorls, additionally, the straight or manubroid portion of the polar tube proceeds beyond the posterior vacuole before it turns anteriorly and begins to coil.},

Here a Bayesian method is presented for estimating parameters of such models from data on patch occupancy in one or more years. Earlier methods were either ad hoc, produced only point estimates, or could only use turnover information. The new method is based on the assumption of quasi-stationarity, which enables it to use not only turnover data, but also snapshot data. Being Bayesian, the method produces reliable information about the uncertainty of the parameters and modelbased predictions in the form of posterior distributions. It is computationally demanding, but considerably faster than a recently developed Bayesian method extended beyond turnover data. The method is compared with existing methods (placed in a Bayesian framework) by fitting an extended incidence function model to a data set on a tree frog metapopulation with many missing values and by predicting its viability, mean occupancy, and turnover rate after 100 yr.},

We used a community genetics approach to study the interaction of barley and aphids in the absence and presence of rhizosphere bacteria. We designed a matrix of aphid genotype and barley genotype combinations and found a significant G \# G \# E interaction, indicating that the barley-aphid interaction is dependent on the genotypes of the interacting species as well as the biotic environment. We discuss the consequences of the strong G \# G \# E interaction found in our study in relation to its impact on the study of species interactions in a community context.},

By doing this, we characterized each B. glabrata strain by its ``multi-parasite susceptibility phenotype'' that reflects better the efficiency of their defense mechanism against not only one, but a diversity of schistosome stocks. In the same time, all the S. mansoni strains used were characterized, by their ``multi-host infectivity phenotype'' that reflects the level of infectivity they display when confronted to diverse snail populations. Based on these results it is possible to select different homogenous stocks of snails with different spectrum of susceptibility/un-susceptibility for several parasite strains. This will be a useful tool for future functional studies conducted to understand the genetics and molecular basis of the compatibility polymorphism in this host/parasite model.},

We conducted cross-year epidemiological, infection and genetic studies of multiple wild host and pathogen populations in the Linum-Melampsora association. We observed asynchronous phenotypic fluctuations in resistance and infectivity among demes. Importantly, changes in allelic frequencies at pathogen infectivity loci, and in host recognition of these genetic variants, correlated with disease prevalence during natural epidemics. These data strongly support reciprocal coevolution maintaining balanced resistance and infectivity polymorphisms, and highlight the importance of characterising spatial and temporal dynamics in antagonistic interactions.},

Here, we focus on the long-term study describing metapopulation dynamics of an obligate pathogen, the powdery mildew (Podosphaera plantaginis) naturally infecting its wild host plant (Plantago lanceolata) in the fragmented landscape of the Aland archipelago (southwest Finland). Regionally, the pathogen persists through a balance of extinctions and colonizations, yet factors affecting extinction rates remain poorly understood. Mycoparasites of the genus Ampelomyces appear as good candidates for testing the role of a hyperparasite, i.e. a parasite of other parasites, in the regulation of their fungal hosts' population dynamics. For this purpose, we first designed a quantitative PCR assay for detection of Ampelomyces spp. in field-collected samples. This newly developed molecular test was then applied to a large-scale sampling within the Aland archipelago, revealing that Ampelomyces is a widespread hyperparasite in this system, with high variability in prevalence among populations. We found that the hyperparasite was more common on leaves where multiple powdery mildew strains coexist, a pattern that may be attributed to differential exposure. Moreover, the prevalence of Ampelomyces at the plant level negatively affected the overwinter survival of its fungal host. We conclude that this hyperparasite may likely impact on its host population dynamics and argue for increased focus on the role of hyperparasites in disease dynamics.},

Yet, under some conditions, faster-growing parasites do not appear to cause more damage, and infections can be quite tolerable. We studied these conditions by assessing how the relationship between parasite population growth and host health is sensitive to environmental variation. In experimental infections of the crustacean Daphnia magna and its bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa, we show how easily an interaction can shift from a severe interaction, that is, when host fitness declines substantially with each unit of parasite growth, to a tolerable relationship by changing only simple environmental variables: temperature and food availability. We explored the evolutionary and epidemiological implications of such a shift by modeling pathogen evolution and disease spread under different levels of infection severity and found that environmental shifts that promote tolerance ultimately result in populations harboring more parasitized individuals. We also find that the opportunity for selection, as indicated by the variance around traits, varied considerably with the environmental treatment. Thus, our results suggest two mechanisms that could underlie coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots: spatial variation in tolerance and spatial variation in the opportunity for selection.},

The prevalence and the mean intensity of Ligula intestinalis (Cestoda) were analysed in roach (Rutilus rutilus) and silver bream (Blicca bjoerkna) populations, the main two infected species. The aim of this study was to investigate the host switch from roach to silver bream and the consequences of L. intestinalis infestation in silver bream, which is an unusual host for this parasite as Ligula parasitism in silver bream appears to be rare. We analysed in detail the relationships between parasitism index (PI), gonadosomatic index (GSI), perivisceral fat abundance (PFA) and condition index (CI) in the silver bream population. In 1998, prevalence of L. intestinalis highlighted a clear host switch from roach to silver bream. In the silver bream population, young fish were the most severely infected and the impact of plerocercoids appeared to be different depending on the host sex. In male silver bream, plerocercoids drew energy from fat reserves even if GSI was also slightly impacted. On the contrary, in females energy was diverted from gonad maturation rather than from perivisceral fat reserves. No significant difference was observed in terms of CI in either sex.},

  abstract = {Within the vertebrate host, infections of a malaria parasite (Plasmodium) could include a single genotype of cells (single-clone infections) or two to several genotypes (multiclone infections). Clonal diversity of infection plays an important role in the biology of the parasite, including its life history, virulence, and transmission. We determined the clonal diversity of Plasmodium mexicanum, a lizard malaria parasite at a study region in northern California, using variable microsatellite markers, the first such study for any malaria parasite of lizards or birds (the most common hosts for Plasmodium species). Multiclonal infections are common (50\textendash{}88\% of infections among samples), and measures of genetic diversity for the metapopulation (expected heterozygosity, number of alleles per locus, allele length variation, and effective population size) all indicated a substantial overall genetic diversity. Comparing years with high prevalence (1996\textendash{}1998 = 25\textendash{}32\% lizards infected), and years with low prevalence (2001\textendash{}2005 = 6\textendash{}12\%) found fewer alleles in samples taken from the low-prevalence years, but no reduction in overall diversity (H = 0.64\textendash{}0.90 among loci). In most cases, rare alleles appeared to be lost as prevalence declined. For sites chronically experiencing low transmission intensity (prevalence \textasciitilde{}1\%), overall diversity was also high (H = 0.79\textendash{}0.91), but there were fewer multiclonal infections. Theory predicts an apparent excess in expected heterozygosity follows a genetic bottleneck. Evidence for such a distortion in genetic diversity was observed after the drop in parasite prevalence under the infinite alleles mutation model but not for the stepwise mutation model. The results are similar to those reported for the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, worldwide, and support the conclusion that malaria parasites maintain high genetic diversity in host populations despite the potential for loss in alleles during the transmission cycle or during periods/locations when transmission intensity is low.},

The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that sex is favored by parasite-mediated selection against common asexual genotypes, leading to the coexistence of sexual and asexual hosts. In a geographic mosaic, where the risk of infection varies in space, the theory also predicts that sexual reproduction would be positively correlated with disease prevalence. We tested this hypothesis in lake populations of a New Zealand freshwater snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum, by comparing pairwise difference matrices for infection frequency and male frequency using partial Mantel tests. We conducted the test at three spatial scales: among lakes on the South Island, among depths within an intensively sampled lake (Lake Alexandrina), and within depths at Lake Alexandrina. We found that the difference in infection risk and the difference in the proportion of sexual snails were significantly and positively correlated at all spatial scales. Our results thus suggest that parasite-mediated selection contributes to the long-term coexistence of sexual and asexual individuals in coevolutionary hotspots, and that the ``warmth'' of hotspots can vary on small spatial scales.},

The microsporidium Octosporea bayeri faces such constraint in a metapopulation of its host, the cladoceran Daphnia magna, where ponds frequently lose their host population due to ponds drying out in summer and freezing in winter. We conducted experiments aimed to investigate the mechanisms of transmission of O. bayeri, and discuss how these mechanisms could contribute to the parasite's permanence in the system. Spores accumulate in the fat cells and the ovaries of the host, and vary in morphology, possibly corresponding to 3 different spore types. Horizontal transmission occurred through the release of spores from dead hosts, with the proportion of infected hosts depending on the spore dose. Further, spores are able to persist outside the host both in dry and wet conditions. Vertical transmission occurred to both parthenogenetic and sexual offspring. The former were invariably infected, while the sexually produced resting eggs (=ephippia) had a less efficient transmission. The parasite may be carried by the ephippia, and thus disperse to new ponds together with the host. Together, these mechanisms may allow the parasite to endure periods of harsh environmental conditions both outside and inside the host.},

Yet, despite the importance of these predictions for evolutionary and conservation issues, empirical studies comparing high-turnover and low-turnover populations of the same species are scarce. In this study, we used Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean, as a model organism for such a comparison. In the southern {$\fracslash$} central part of its range, D. magna inhabits medium-sized, stable ponds, whereas in the north, it occurs in small rock pools with strong population turnover. We found that these northern populations have a significantly lower genetic diversity and higher genetic differentiation compared to the southern {$\fracslash$} central populations. Total genetic diversity across populations was only about half and average within-population diversity only about a third of that in southern {$\fracslash$} central populations. Moreover, an average southern population contains more genetic diversity than the whole metapopulation system in the north. We based our analyses both on silent sites and microsatellites. The similarity of our results despite the contrasting mutation rates of these markers suggests that the differences are caused by contemporary rather than by historical processes. Our findings show that variation in population turnover and population size may have a major impact on the genetic diversity and differentiation of populations, and hence may lead to differences in evolutionary processes like local adaptation, hybrid vigour and breeding system evolution in different parts of a species range.},

Eleven or 14 days postinfection (p.i.) the presence and growth of the cestode larvae relative to survival, growth and reproduction of their host was determined. As expected, the probability of a copepod becoming infected increased with increasing numbers of parasites administered. However, the chances of a single coracidium establishing in a copepod also increased with increasing numbers of coracidia administered, which indicates that the parasites profit from a dilution effect of the host's defence. Copepod size or developmental stage had no significant effect on the infection, but 14 days p.i., constraining effects of copepod size on the growth of the parasites were apparent. Moreover, procercoids in multiple infections grew smaller and developed their cercomer at a smaller size than those in single infections. No significant effect of the parasite on host mortality was found within the observation period. However, growth between the 5th copepodid stage and adult stage was negatively affected by infection. An infection with S. solidus was also strongly linked with host reproduction : infected females were more likely to bear an egg sac at the end of the experiment than non-infected ones.

Eight microsporidian taxa were detected, including 3 that previously had not been characterized genetically. Microsporidian communities from nearby lakes were found to be more similar to each other, apparently due to short distance dispersal via secondary hosts. Moreover, we detected seasonal (but not interannual) changes in microsporidian community structure. With some microsporidia being host-specific, these changes might have resulted from seasonal changes in host taxon and clonal composition. The 2 dominant and closely related parasite species were found mainly in single infections, whereas another pair of related microsporidians was found predominantly in co-infections; suggesting species-level differences in the ability to colonize infected hosts. By applying molecular methods, we were not only able to unambiguously identify parasite taxa but also to reveal multiple infections that otherwise would have remained undetected. Given the increased level of accuracy and sensitivity, we highly recommend molecular approaches in future parasite surveys of Daphnia infections.},

Two groups of monkeys were immunized against either of two strains of P. cynomolgi, namely PcCeylon and Pc746, by giving two successive drug-cured infections with asexual blood-stage parasites of one or the other strain, 12-weeks apart. To test for strain-specific protective immunity these infection-immunized monkeys were challenged 8 weeks later with a mixture of asexual blood-stage parasites of both strains. A pyrosequencing-based assay was used to quantify the proportion of parasites that survived in the challenge infections. The assay was based on a SNP within the P. cynomolgi Merozoite Surface Protein-1 gene. Compared to their behaviour in nonimmunized monkeys, the growth of parasites of the homologous (immunizing) strain in mixed-strain challenge infections in the immunized monkeys were reduced relative to that of the nonimmunizing strain. These results indicate the development of blood infection-induced strain-specific protective immunity against P. cynomolgi in toque monkeys.

Differences among the three species were consistent with estimates of their seed-dispersal abilities. Populations of Cryptotaenia, with the most limited seed dispersal, are characterized by genetic structure at smaller spatial scales than those of Osmorhiza or Sanicula, as indicated by higher estimates of O(Fs,), larger autocorrelation coefficients, and correlograms with more distant x-intercepts. Although spatial autocorrelation was somewhat more sensitive to the distribution of rare alleles than F-statistics, the two methods were generally concordant. Genetic structure was more pronounced, and inbreeding coefficients larger, in low-density, patchy populations than in a high-density site. Observed patterns of spatial autocorrelation, particularly for Cryptotaenia, were in agreement with expectations based on simulations of isolation by distance. The magnitude of observed autocorrelations was less than those typically produced in computer-simulation studies, but this discrepancy between empirical and theoretical results probably is derived from a lack of genetic and demographic equilibrium in natural populations. Isolation by distance can be an important evolutionary force organizing spatial genetic structure in plant populations, particularly in predominantly self-fertilizing species such as those studied here.},

  abstract = {We investigated transmission pathways for two tick species, Bothriocroton hydrosauri and Amblyomma limbatum, among their sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) hosts in a natural population in South Australia. Our aim was to determine whether a transmission network model continued to predict parasite load patterns effectively under varying ecological conditions. Using GPS loggers we identified the refuge sites used by each lizard on each day. We estimated infectious time windows for ticks that detached from a lizard in a refuge. Time windows were from the time when a detached tick molted and become infective, until the time it died from desiccation while waiting for a new host. Previous research has shown that A. limbatum molts earlier and survives longer than B. hydrosauri. We developed two transmission network models based on these differences in infective time windows for the two tick species. Directed edges were generated in the network if one lizard used a refuge that had previously been used by another lizard within the infectious time window. We used those models to generate values of network node instrength for each lizard, a measure of how strongly connected an individual is to other lizards in the transmission network, and a prediction of infection risk for each host. The consistent correlations over time between B. hydrosauri infection intensity and network derived infection risk suggest that network models can be robust to environmental variation among years. However, the contrasting lack of consistent correlation in A. limbatum suggests that the utility of the same network models may depend on the specific biology of a parasite species.},

We compared the population genetic structure of two co-occurring parasite species of Daphnia, to collect evidence for their expected transmission modes. The ichthyosporean Caullerya mesnili has a direct life cycle, whereas the microsporidian Berwaldia schaefernai is hypothesized to require passage through a secondary host. The parasites were collected from three geographically isolated Daphnia populations. The nucleotide variation in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was assessed at the within-individual, within-population and among-population levels, using AMOVA. We detected significant partitioning at all levels, except for a lack of among-population variation in Berwaldia. This was confirmed by neighbour-joining and principal component analyses; Caullerya populations were distinct from each other, while there was much overlap among parasite isolates representing different populations of Berwaldia. This all implies a higher amount of gene flow for Berwaldia, consistent with the hypothesized transmission mode.},

  abstract = {Background: Detailed knowledge of spatial and temporal variation in the genetic population structure of hosts and parasites is required for understanding of host - parasite coevolution. As hot-spots of contemporary coevolution in natural systems are difficult to detect and long-term studies are restricted to few systems, additional population genetic data from various host - parasite systems may provide important insights into the topic. This is particularly true for parasites, as these players have been under-investigated so far due to the lower availability of suitable molecular markers. Here, we traced genetic variation (based on sequence variants in the internal transcribed spacer region, ITS) among seven geographically isolated populations of the ichthyosporean Caullerya mesnili, a common microparasite of the cladoceran Daphnia (here, the D. longispina hybrid complex). At three sites, we also studied parasite genetic variation over time (three to four sampling points) and tested for associations between parasite genotypes and host species.
Results: Parasite (and host) populations were significantly structured across space, indicating limited dispersal. Moreover, the frequency of parasite genotypes varied significantly over time, suggesting rapid evolutionary change in Caullerya. However, the distribution of parasite genotypes was similar across different host species, which might in turn have important consequences for parasite epidemiology.
Conclusions: The approach proposed here can be applied to track spatial and temporal changes in the population structure of other microparasite species for which sequence variation in the ITS or other highly variable genome regions has been documented but other types of polymorphic markers are lacking. Screening of parasite sequence variants allows for reliable detection of cross-species infections and, using advanced sequencing techniques in the near future, for detailed studies of parasite evolution in natural host - parasite systems.},

Coevolution between hosts and parasites is a practical example of interacting ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Antagonistic interactions theoretically and experimentally increase host diversity, but the contribution of novel variation to diversity is not well understood. In laboratory or natural settings it is infeasible to prohibit novel mutations in communities while still allowing frequencies of extant organisms to change. We turn to digital organisms to investigate the effects of rapid evolution on host-parasite community diversity in the presence and absence of novel variation. We remove the source of variation in coevolved digital host-parasite communities and allow them to reach an equilibrium. We find that coevolved host-parasite communities are surprisingly stable in the absence of new variation. However, the communities at equilibrium are less diverse than those that continued to experience mutations. In either case, hosts coevolving with parasites are significantly more diverse than hosts evolving alone. Harnessing an advantage of in silico evolution, we show that novel variation increases host diversity in communities with parasites further than the trivial increase expected from new mutations.},

  abstract = {Virulence is thought to be a driving force in host\textendash{}pathogen coevolution. Theoretical models suggest that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of pathogens evolving towards a high rate of intrahost reproduction. These models predict a positive correlation between the reproductive fitness of a pathogen and its level of virulence. Theoretical models also suggest that the demography and genetic structure of a host population can influence the evolution of virulence. If evolution occurs faster in pathogen populations than in host populations, the predicted result is local adaptation of the pathogen population. In our studies, we used a combination of molecular and physiological markers to test these hypotheses in an agricultural system. We isolated five strains of the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola from each of two wheat cultivars that differed in their level of resistance to this pathogen. Each of the 10 fungal strains had distinct genotypes as indicated by different DNA fingerprints. These fungal strains were re-inoculated onto the same two host cultivars in a field experiment and their genotype frequencies were monitored over several generations of asexual reproduction. We also measured the virulence of these 10 fungal strains and correlated it to the reproductive fitness of each fungal strain. We found that host genotypes had a strong impact on the dynamics of the pathogen populations. The pathogen population collected from the moderately resistant cultivar Madsen showed greater stability, higher genotype diversity, and smaller selection coefficients than the pathogen populations collected from the susceptible cultivar Stephens or a mixture of the two host cultivars. The pathogen collection from the mixed host population was midway between the two pure lines for most parameters measured. Our results also revealed that the measures of reproductive fitness and virulence of a pathogen strain were not always correlated. The pathogen strains varied in their patterns of local adaptation, ranging from locally adapted to locally maladapted.},

In the presence of multiple predictors, we provide empirical evidence that the observed monotone directions via parametric, nonparametric or semiparametric fit of commonly used multi-dimensional models may entirely violate the actual directions of monotonicity. This breakdown is caused primarily by the dependence structure of covariates, with negligible influence from the bias of function estimation. To examine the linkage between the dependent covariates and monotone directions, we first generalize Stein's Lemma for random variables which are mutually independent Gaussian to two important cases: dependent Gaussian, and independent non-Gaussian. We show that in both two cases, there is an explicit one-to-one correspondence between the monotone directions of a multi-dimensional function and the signs of a deterministic surrogate vector. Moreover, we demonstrate that the second case can be extended to accommodate a class of dependent covariates. This generalization further enables us to develop a de-correlation transform for arbitrarily dependent covariates. The transformed covariates preserve modeling interpretability with little loss in modeling efficiency. The simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated via simulation studies and real data application.},
